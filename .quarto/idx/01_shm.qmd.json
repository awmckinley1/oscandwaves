It is a model which is widely used in modelling systems due to its simplicity.\n\nIn general, an object will move under SHM where its acceleration is:\n\n1.  proportional to its displacement, but\n2.  in the opposite direction.\n\nThe force causing this acceleration is often termed a *restoring force* as it acts to push the object back to its starting point.\n\n## A simple example of SHM {#sec-ch1-simpleshmexample}\n\nConsider a block on a spring (@fig-ch1-blockonspring1)\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, ch1-blockonspring1, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.align=\"center\", auto_pdf=TRUE, fig.cap=\"A mass on a spring, stretched distance $x$ past its equilibrium length $x_0$\"}\n#| label: fig-ch1-blockonspring1\n#| fig-cap: \"A mass on a spring, stretched distance $x$ past its equilibrium length $x_0$\"\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"visualisations/LaTeX/ch1-blockonspring1.svg\",auto_pdf = getOption(\"knitr.graphics.auto_pdf\", TRUE))\n```\n\nBy Hooke's law, the spring exerts a force on the block proportional to its displacement $x$, but in the opposite direction, pushing the block back to its equilbrium position, shown mathematically in @eq-hookeslaw1:\n\n<!-- \\begin{equation} -->\n\n$$F_x = -kx\n$$ {#eq-hookeslaw1} <!-- \\end{equation} -->\n\nIn this example, $F_x$ is considered a **restoring force**, while $k$ is the force constant of the spring.\n\nApplying Newton's Second Law to this problem, we can obtain the mathematical description of the system (@eq-test1):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_x = ma_x \\\\\nkx = m\\frac{\\textrm{d}^2 x}{\\textrm{d} t^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-test1}\n\n... and through rearrangement and combination with @eq-hookeslaw1 we obtain the description of how this mass will move (@eq-shm-massonspring1):\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}^2 x}{\\textrm{d} t^2} = -\\frac{k}{m}x\n$$ {#eq-shm-massonspring1}\n\nThe general form of this expression for any system can be considered as shown in @eq-shm-general-massonspring1:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}^2 x}{\\textrm{d} t^2} = -Cx \\quad\\mathrm{or}\\quad\\ddot{x} = -Cx\n$$ {#eq-shm-general-massonspring1}\n\n...where $C$ is a positive constant which depends on the system and represents a ratio of the elastic ($k$) and inertial ($m$) contributions within the system.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Key Terms\n\n-   **Period**: The time $T$ for one complete oscilation back and forth (units s)\n-   **Frequency**: The reciprocal of the period; $f = \\frac{1}{T}$, units s^-1^ or Hz.\n:::\n\n## Positioning in SHM {#sec-shm-position}\n\nSHM can be described by a general equation of motion, defining the position ($x$) of the oscillating mass using a cosine function (@eq-shm-general-positionx1):\n\n$$\nx = A \\cos (\\omega t + \\delta)\n$$ {#eq-shm-general-positionx1}\n\nThe parameters in this equation are:\n\n-   $A$: The amplitude of the oscillation\n-   $\\omega t + \\delta$: Phase of motion\n-   $\\delta$: Phase constant\n\nFor any single oscillator, the time origin can always be chosen so that $\\delta = 0$.

In most problems, we wish to determine the value of these constants. In order to determine these, we establish the initial conditions of the oscillation.\n\nIn @fig-shm-general-comparison-xva we defined our displacement at $+A$ which set up the rest of the problem. However, we will not always be so fortunate. For a general case, we then need to be more discerning.\n\nWe can establish expressions for both the amplitude and the phase component by setting $t = 0$ in our general expressions (@eq-ch1-shm-initconditions1):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rclcrcl}\nx_t &=& A  \\cos (\\omega t + \\delta)       & \\rightarrow & x_0 &=& A  \\cos (\\delta)\\\\\nv_t &=& -A \\omega \\sin (\\omega t + \\delta)& \\rightarrow & v_0 &=& -A \\omega \\sin ( \\delta)\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch1-shm-initconditions1} We now treat these as simultaneous equations to find $\\delta$ and $A$ (@eq-ch1-shm-initconditions2)[^01_shm-1]:\n\n[^01_shm-1]: Note that we use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2 \\alpha + \\sin^2 \\alpha = 1$ to find $A$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\tan \\delta = \\dfrac{\\sin \\delta}{\\cos \\delta} = -\\dfrac{v_0}{\\omega x_0} & \\textrm{and} & A^2 = x_0^2 + \\dfrac{v_0^2}{\\omega^2}\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch1-shm-initconditions2}\n\n## Frequency and angular frequency {#sec-shm-freq-angularfreq}\n\nIn @sec-shm-comparing-xva we stated that the nature of the oscillation meant that it repeats after every oscillation; mathematically $x(t) = x(t + T)$; the position $x$ at time $t$ is equal to the position at time $(t+T)$.\n\nWhen we apply this to the velocity, we obtain the following expression:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nv(t) &=& v(t+T) \\\\\nA \\cos (\\omega t + \\delta) &=& A \\cos (\\omega (t+T) + \\delta) \\\\\n&=& A \\cos ([\\omega t + \\delta] + \\omega T)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nDue to the cyclic nature of a cosine function, $\\cos (\\alpha) = \\cos (\\alpha + 2\\pi)$, this must therefore mean (@eq-ch1-definingomega1):\n\n$$\n\\omega T = 2\\pi \\hspace{10pt} \\textrm{or} \\hspace{10pt} \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}\n$$ {#eq-ch1-definingomega1}\n\nThis gives us a way to think about $\\omega$; its connection to circular motion (the clue is the $2\\pi$). It can be thought of as the **angular frequency**, with units radians s^-1^, and an oscillation of $2\\pi$ radians corresponds to one period of oscillation.\n\nAdditionally, since the frequency of the oscillation $f$ is the reciprocal of the period of oscillation ($f = \\frac{1}{T}$), the angular frequency can be rewritten as $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, and $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$.\n\nFor the spring system we discussed in @sec-ch1-simpleshmexample, we stated that the angular frequency $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$. Therefore we can obtain an expression for the frequency of our oscillator (@eq-ch1-freq-angfreq1):\n\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\n$$ {#eq-ch1-freq-angfreq1} Inspection of this equation reveals the behaviour of our oscillator:\n\n-   If we have a stiffer spring (larger $k$), we expect the frequency $f$ to increase,\n-   If we use an oscillator with larger mass (larger $m$), we would expect the frequency ($f$) to decrease.\n-   The frequency (and therefore period) of simple harmonic oscillation is independent of amplitude.[^01_shm-2]\n\n[^01_shm-2]: A caveat to this is for large amplitudes where other factors start to affect the behaviour. But this is then no longer *simple* harmonic motion!\n\n## SHM and circular motion {#sec-ch1-shmcircmotion1}\n\nWe mentioned an \"angular frequency\" for SHM; this would appear to suggest behaviour akin to circular motion. It is therefore worth exploring our descriptions of circular motion.\n\nImagine a point mass moving in a circle (@fig-ch1-circularmotion1).

As with any potential energy field, the force on this particle is given by the gradient of the potential energy and is directed down the potential energy slope. Mathematically, for a potential energy field, the force may be found as follows (@eq-ch1-forceenergyderiv1):\n\n$$\nF = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}r}\n$${#eq-ch1-forceenergyderiv1}\n\nIn a one-dimensional system, this is expressed as follows (@eq-ch1-forceenergyderiv2):\n\n$$\nF_x = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}x}\n$${#eq-ch1-forceenergyderiv2}\n\nAs mentioned in @sec-ch1-simpleshmexample, under SHM the force is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and in the opposite direction; *i.e.*:\n\n$$\nF_x = -kx\n$${#eq-ch1-hookeslaw1}\n\nApplying the principle from @eq-ch1-forceenergyderiv1 we can therefore integrate this experession with respect to $x$ to obtain the expression for our potential energy.

This is found by relating the force from the spring and the force of gravity acting on the mass (@eq-ch1-massverticalspring1):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\mathrm{Force~due~to~spring~extension} &=& \\mathrm{Gravity~acting~on~mass}\\\\\nk y_0 &=& mg\\\\\ny_0 &=& \\dfrac{mg}{k}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch1-massverticalspring1}\n\nWe now apply the Second Law of motion to obtain an expression for the acceleration on the mass due to the forces acting on it (the spring force and gravity).\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nm\\ddot{y}&=&  \\textrm{spring force} + \\textrm{gravity} \\\\\nm\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} &=& -ky + mg\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch1-massverticalspring2}\nIn this expression, $y$ is the total extension of the spring (the extension to the mass equilibrium point, $y_0$ plus the displacement from this point, $y^\\prime$).\n\nWe now substitute a variable; since $y = y_0 + y^\\prime$, we substitute $y$ for $y^\\prime$:\n\n-   $y = y_0 + y^\\prime$\n-   $y^\\prime = y - y_0$\n\nSince $y_0$ is a constant:\n\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d} y^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\hspace{10pt} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10pt} \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d} t^2}\n$$\nReplacing $y$ for $(y_0 + y^\\prime)$ in @eq-ch1-massverticalspring2, we obtain @eq-ch1-massverticalspring3:\n\n$$\nm\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = -k(y_0 + y^\\prime) + mg\n$${#eq-ch1-massverticalspring3}\nSince $ky_0 = mg$ (@eq-ch1-massverticalspring1), we can therefore eliminate these terms from @eq-ch1-massverticalspring3, and rewrite as @eq-ch1-massverticalspring4):\n\n$$\nm\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = -k y^\\prime\n$${#eq-ch1-massverticalspring4}\n\nThis means that, in reference to @fig-ch1-massverticalspring1, we still have SHM centered on the equilibrium position of the mass. This may seem like a self-evident result, however it is useful to recognise the role of gravity; its effect is to shift the equilibrium position of the oscillation from $y = 0$ (the equilibrium position of the spring) to $y = y_0$ ($y^\\prime = 0$).\n\nLet's now consider the energy in this system. The system already contains some elastic energy as the spring is already stretched to $y_0$ by the gravity acting on the mass:\n\n$$\n\\textrm{elastic potential energy} = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 - \\frac{1}{2}ky_0^2\n$$\nThe gravitational potential energy (relative to the starting position $y_0$) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\textrm{gravitational potential energy} = mg(y-y_0)\n$$\nThe total potential energy is therefore given by @eq-ch1-massverticalspring5:\n\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 - \\frac{1}{2}ky_0^2 - mg(y-y_0)\n$${#eq-ch1-massverticalspring5}\n\nWe can then show that the total potential energy expression in @eq-ch1-massverticalspring5 can be simplified to that shown in Equation @eq-ch1-massverticalspring6:\n\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} ky^{\\prime 2}\n$${#eq-ch1-massverticalspring6}\n**You should ensure you understand how this simplification is done**; this is left as an exercise.[^01_shm-5]\n\n[^01_shm-5]: Yes; we know this sort of thing infuriates learners, however it is based in valid educational practice! Do give it a go. In this instance, remember that you will need to start with @eq-ch1-massverticalspring5, recall the relation of $y$ and $y^\\prime$, substitute this into the equation, expand and cancel terms.\n\nOverall, the expression for the total potential energy shown in @eq-ch1-massverticalspring6 will still yield a parabola and as such the oscillation is still a simple harmonic oscillation as before.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"01_shm.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
