In order to maintain the amplitude of any oscillation we must supply energy to the system at the same rate as it is lost to the surroundings; for example, pushing a child on a swing.\n\nThe equation for forced SHM is given in @eq-ch5-forcedshm1:\n\n$$\nm \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + b \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}+ kx = F_0 \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedshm1}\n\nCompare this to @eq-ch2-velocitydamp3 for damped SHM; we have now applied an oscillating force represented as $F_0 \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}$, with an amplitude of $F_0$ and frequency $\\omega$.  Note that this driving frequency $\\omega$ is different  to the natural *undamped* frequency of the oscillator, $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$ and different again to the frequency of the damped *unforced* oscillator, $\\omega^\\prime = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4m^2}}$.\n\nAny forced oscillation consists of two distinct regimes:\n\n1. An initial transient period during which the oscillations are established, and\n1. A steady state period during which the oscillations have constant amplitude and a frequency equal to the driving frequency, $\\omega$.\n\nThe general solution of the equation for forced SHM shown in @eq-ch5-forcedshm1 is a combination of these two regimes.\n\n## The Transient Solution {#sec-ch5-transientsolution}\n\nThe solution to the transient component of the forced oscillator is identical to the solution of damped SHM (*i.e.* @eq-ch5-forcedshm1 with the right-hand side set to zero; identical to @eq-ch2-velocitydamp3). Its solution is shown in @eq-ch5-forcedshm2:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lrcl}\n & x &=& A_0 \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t + \\delta^\\prime \\right)} \\\\\n\\textsf{or:} & x &=& A_0 \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\cos \\left( \\omega^\\prime t + \\delta^\\prime \\right) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedshm2}\n\nThis contribution to motion establishes the oscillation, but rapidly decays with time constant $\\tau = \\frac{m}{b}$. The term $\\delta^\\prime$ is simply the phase constant for this transient oscillation.\n\n## The Steady State solution {#sec-ch5-steadystatesolution}\n\nOnce in the steady state, the energy which is put into the system during each cycle is equal to the energy dissipated per cycle due to the damping in the system.  If there is no damping of the system, energy keeps being added to the system and the amplitude will increase indefinitely. This is **not** a steady state, and is an **unphysical result**.  The frequency then of this 'driven' oscillator in the steady state is equal to the driving frequency.\n\nThe amplitude (and hence the energy) of the system in the steady state depends on both the **amplitude** and the **frequency** of the driving force.  For a steady state, the solution to @eq-ch5-forcedshm1 is in the form shown in @eq-ch5-forcedshm3:\n\n$$\nx = A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedshm3}\n\nThe terms $A$ and $\\delta$ are defined in @eq-ch5-forcedshm4 and @eq-ch5-forcedshm5 below:\n\n$$\nA = \\frac{F_0}{\\sqrt{m^2 \\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 \\right)^2 + b^2 \\omega^2}}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedshm4}\n\n$$\n\\delta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{b\\omega}{m \\left(  \\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 \\right)} \\right)\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedshm5}\n\n## Steady state behaviour - Resonance {#sec-ch5-steadystatebehaviour}\n\nWhen we vary the frequency of the driving frequency we find that the response of the driven system varies.  If we examine the power transferred to the system as we vary the driving frequency, we see that there is a peak around the natural frequency, $\\omega_0$, of the driven system (@fig-ch5-resonancepowerfrequency1). This is a phenomenon known as **resonance**.  \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, ch5-resonancepowerfrequency1, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.align=\"center\", auto_pdf=TRUE, fig.cap=\"The power transferred to a system varies with the driving frequency. The power transferred to a system is proportional to $\\\\omega A^2$. The full-width at half-maximum value is designated $\\\\Delta \\\\omega$.

A large FWHM indicates a broad signal over a range of frequencies, while a small FWHM indicates a sharp signal over a narrow band of frequencies.] This FWHM is designated by $\\Delta \\omega$ in @fig-ch5-resonancepowerfrequency1 and is related to the $Q$-factor of the system via @eq-ch5-resonancequality1:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{1}{Q}\n$${#eq-ch5-resonancequality1}\n\nThis allows us to determine the $Q$-factor of a system through measurement of resonance of the system, as a lightly-damped system (high $Q$) will give a sharp resonance with low $\\Delta \\omega$, while a more heavily damped system will lead to a more broad resonance profile.\n\nThis use of the $Q$-factor is important as it give us a measure of the 'sharpness' (or quality) of the resonance.  It may be applied to many systems including electronic circuits.\n\nWe can also examine the phase of the oscillator's displacement $x$ relative to that of the driving force, $\\delta$, shown in @fig-ch5-resonancephaseshift1.\n\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, ch5-resonancephaseshift1, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.align=\"center\", auto_pdf=TRUE, fig.cap=\"The phase shift $\\\\delta$ of the observed oscillation varies relative to the driving frequency $\\\\omega$.\"}\n#| label: fig-ch5-resonancephaseshift1\n#| fig-cap: \"The phase shift $\\\\delta$ of the observed oscillation varies relative to the driving frequency $\\\\omega$.\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"visualisations/ch5-forcedosc3.svg\",auto_pdf = getOption(\"knitr.graphics.auto_pdf\", TRUE))\n```\n\nWe can see that at low driving frequencies, there is very little phase shift between the two (the force is at a minimum when the displacement is at a minimum and is in the same direction), while at very high driving frequencies we approach a maximum phase shift of $\\pi$ between the two (force still at a minimum at minimum displacement, but now the force is directed in the opposite direction to the displacement; akin to SHM). The phase change is at its most rapid when the frequency of the driving force $\\omega$ is similar to the natural frequency of the oscillator ($\\omega_0$). At this point, the driving force are \"in quadrature\" (90$^\\circ$ out of phase), with the force at a maximum when $x$ is changing most rapidly.\n\n## Full solution of the forced oscillator {#sec-ch5-fullsolutionforcedoscillator}\n\nAs with the damped oscillator explored in @sec-ch2-dampedoscillations, the full solution of the forced oscillator is found through the combination of the \"transient state\" (a free, damped system) and the \"steady state\" (fully forced oscillations).  This is illustrated in @eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln1:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lrcccc}\n& x &=& \\textsf{transient} &+&\\textsf{steady state} \\\\\n\\textit{i.e.} & x&=& A_0 \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t + \\delta^\\prime \\right)} &+&  A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln1}\n\nThe terms in @eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln1 are as follows:\n\n* $\\delta$ is given by @eq-ch5-forcedshm5;\n* $A$ given by @eq-ch5-forcedshm4;\n* $A_0$ and $\\delta^\\prime$ depend on the initial conditions;\n* $\\omega$ is the driving frequency;\n* $\\omega^\\prime$ is the frequency of the damped (transient) oscillations.\n\nWe can simplify our view of @eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln1 by applying initial conditions whereby the displacement $x = 0$ at time $t = 0$. Therefore:\n\n$$\n0 = A_0 \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\delta^\\prime \\right)} + A \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\delta}\n$$\n\n...or, to rearrange, we obtain the form shown in @eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln2:\n\n$$\nA_0 = -A \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right)}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln2}\n\nAs with any complex representation, we now compare the **real** and **imaginary** parts of the solution.  Remember that @eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln2 expands *via* De Moivre's theorem to:\n\n$$\nA_0 = -A \\left( \\cos \\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right) + \\mathrm{i} \\sin \\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right)  \\right)\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln3}\n\nThe imaginary component of @eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln3 reduces to zero (the solution, $A_0$ is fully real):\n\n$$\n0 = -A \\sin \\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right)\n$$\n\nWe can therefore relate $\\delta$ and $\\delta^\\prime$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\delta + \\delta^\\prime = \\pi & \\textit{i.e.} & \\delta^\\prime = \\pi - \\delta\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedoscillationfullsoln4}\n\nWe now examine the 'real' component of @eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln3, equal to $A_0$:\n\n$$\nA_0 = - A \\cos \\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right)\n$$\n\n...and doing the same analysis, now that we know that, under our initial conditions, $\\delta + \\delta^\\prime = \\pi$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nA_0 = -A \\cos \\pi & \\textit{i.e.} & A_0 = A\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedoscillationfullsoln5}\n\nWe can now revisit @eq-ch5-forcedoscillfullsoln1, now that we have values for $\\delta$, $\\delta^\\prime$ and $A_0$ under our starting conditions ( $x = 0$ when $t = 0$):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx &= & A \\left[ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}  + \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t + \\delta^\\prime \\right)} \\right]\\\\\n&= & A \\left[ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}  + \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t + \\pi - \\delta \\right)} \\right]\\\\\n&= & A \\left[ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}  + \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t - \\delta \\right)} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\pi} \\right]\\\\\n&= & A \\left[ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}  - \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t - \\delta \\right)}  \\right]\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedoscillationfullsoln6}\n\nFinally, we can find the actual displacement of the oscillator by examining the real component of @eq-ch5-forcedoscillationfullsoln6, summarised in @eq-ch5-forcedoscillationfullsoln7):\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}(x) = A \\left[ \\cos (\\omega t - \\delta) - \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\cos (\\omega^\\prime t - \\delta) \\right]\n$${#eq-ch5-forcedoscillationfullsoln7}\n\nWe can visualise the amplitude of a forced oscillator, as shown in @fig-ch5-forcedoscilfull1.  At very low frequencies, the oscillation has the same amplitude as the driving oscillation.

These properties of circuits have many important applications and you will find that much of the analysis we have done here can be applied to those electrical systems.\n\nIn the context of an electrical circuit it is useful to define the term **impedance** a measure of the opposition to the flow of current, and is defined as the ratio of the voltage to current ($\\frac{V}{I}$) for a particular circuit component. For a resistor this is simply the resistance, however capacitors and inductors also possess impedance.\n\nIt turns out to be helpful to write this impedance as a complex number with components in both the real and imaginary plane. This works well with the complex representation of oscillations and naturally takes care of any differences in phase of the current and voltage in different components.\n\nBringing the analogy back to mechanical oscillations, a mechanical system can also be considered to have an impedance.  We define the mechanical impedance as the **force required to produce unit velocity**, *i.e.* $Z_m = \\frac{F}{v}$, or $F = vZ_m$.  This is the mechanical equivalent of Ohm's law; force corresponding to the voltage, and velocity corresponding to current.\n\nThis idea of mechanical impedance will be useful in discussion of wave propagation.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"02a_forced_oscillations.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
