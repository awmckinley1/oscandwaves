We can go further than this, and specify general expressions which can satisfy the wave equation.  \n\nSpecifically, if we have two functions, $y_1$ and $y_2$ (@eq-ch10-superposition1), which satisfy the wave equation, then their sum (@eq-ch10-superposition2), including scaling constants $C_1$ and $C_2$) must also satisfy the wave equation.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_1 &=& A_1 \\sin\\left[k_1(x \\pm vt)\\right] \\\\\ny_2 &=& A_2 \\sin\\left[k_2(x \\pm vt)\\right] \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-superposition1}\n\n\n$$\ny_3 = C_1 y_1 + C_2 y_2\n$${#eq-ch10-superposition2}\n\nUsing double angle formulae we can demonstrate that $y_3$ can also be written in the form $y = f(x \\pm vt)$, thus satisfying the wave equation.^[When including scaling factors, this can become less than trivial, but can still be done.] Therefore, the new wave $y_3$ is a linear superposition of the original waves $y_1$ and $y_2$.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the wave equation was derived in the case of small amplitude disturbances; therefore if the vibration amplitudes become too large, the principle of superposition may fail.  This can lead to some very interesting effects, including **non-linear optics**^[Related to the non-linear response of the electromagnetic interactions with the medium, rather than light travelling in straight lines!]\n\n## Two waves with same amplitude and frequency {#sec-ch10-identicalwaves1}\n\nLet's now consider two waves with the same amplitude and frequency; but differing in phase (@eq-ch10-superposition3):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_1 &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t) \\\\\ny_2 &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t +\\delta ) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-superposition3}\n\nIf the two waves are superimposed, for example if they are travelling through the same medium, the resultant wavefunction is just the sum of $y_1$ and $y_2$ (@eq-ch10-superposition4):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny &=& y_1 + y_2 \\\\\n  &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t) + y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t +\\delta )\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-superposition4}\n\nIn many situations it is mathematically simpler to use the complex exponential notation to treat waves and oscillations.

If $\\delta = 0$, the waves are exactly in phase and the waves add together (constructive interference), with amplitude $A = 2 y_0$;\n1. If $\\delta = \\pi$, the waves are exactly out of phase and the waves subtract (destructive interference), and the amplitude $A = 0$;\n1. If $\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, the resultant wave has exactly the same amplitude as the input waves.\n\nAll three of these cases can be derived by substituting the relevant value of $\\delta$ into @eq-ch10-superposition5c).\n\n### Phasors {#sec-ch10-phasors1}\n\nThe process we have shown above is a specific case of using *phasors* to determine an amplitude of a superposition of waves.  The general method for determining the superposition of a number of waves of the same frequency - regardless of amplitude or relative phase - is shown as follows.\n\nFor a series of waves (@eq-ch10-generalwaves1), each with its own amplitude $A_n$ and relative phase $\\delta_n$, we can determine a superposition by summing them together.\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\ny_1 = A_1 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_1)} \\\\\ny_2 = A_2 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_2)} \\\\\ny_3 = A_3 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_3)} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n$${#eq-ch10-generalwaves1}\n\n\nThe summation is straightforward:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_{\\mathrm{total}} &=&  y_1 + y_2 + y_3 \\\\\n&=& A_1 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_1)} + A_2 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_2)} + A_3 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_3)}\\\\\n&=& \\left(A_1 e^{i\\delta_1} + A_2 e^{i\\delta_2} + A_3 e^{i\\delta_3} \\right) e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-generalwaves2}\n\nBy taking out a common factor of $e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}$ from the superposition, we have isolated the variable \"wave component\" ($e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}$) from the invariant (constant) component, ($\\left(A_1 e^{i\\delta_1} + A_2 e^{i\\delta_2} + A_3 e^{i\\delta_3} \\right)$).  This 'invariant' component is the amplitude of the new superposition, and thus we have expressed our superposition as the original wave - with a 'zero phase' offset - and an amplitude.\n\nAs the new amplitude is a sum of complex numbers, we can visualise these on an Argand diagram (@fig-ch10-argand-phasors)\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, ch10-argand-phasors, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.align=\"center\", auto_pdf=TRUE, fig.cap=\"The amplitude component of a wave superposition can be represented on an Argand diagram, where the total amplitude can be determined as the resultant of the sum of the complex amplitudes.\"}\n#| label: fig-ch10-argand-phasors\n#| fig-cap: \"The amplitude component of a wave superposition can be represented on an Argand diagram, where the total amplitude can be determined as the resultant of the sum of the complex amplitudes.\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"visualisations/LaTeX/ch10-argand-phasors.svg\",auto_pdf = getOption(\"knitr.graphics.auto_pdf\", TRUE))\n```\n\nThis method will work for any values of $\\delta$ and any amplitudes $A$, provided the frequency $\\omega$ and wavenumber $k$ of the superposed waves is constant.\n\n## Two waves, same amplitude, different frequency (Beats) {#sec-ch10-differentwaves1}\n\nLet's consider two waves with the same amplitude but differing in frequency (*i.e.* amplitude $y_0$ is common to both, each has independent frequency $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega 2$).

We can simplify the expression as in @eq-ch12-addtwowavebeats5.\n\n$$\ny = \\underbrace{ 2y_{0} \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{2}t \\right)}_{\\textsf{slowly varying amplitude}} \\underbrace{ \\sin \\omega_{av}t}_{\\textsf{wave with average frequency}}\n$${#eq-ch12-addtwowavebeats5}\n\n...where $\\Delta \\omega = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2$.\n\nThe frequency fo the resulting wave is the average of the two input waves, while the amplitude oscillates with frequency $\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{2}$. This is known as **beating**.  The actual frequency of the beats themselves is twice this, as shown in @fig-ch12-oscillationbeats1.\n\n\n```{r echo=FALSE,  ch12-oscillationbeats1, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.align=\"center\", auto_pdf=TRUE, fig.cap=\"As two waves interfere with each other ($f_1 = 3.0$ Hz; $f_2 = 3.2$ Hz), we see the interference structure as a waveform of frequency 3.1 Hz with a slowly varying amplitude at frequency 0.1 Hz (the 'envelope').

These are laid out below:\n\nThe phase velocity of the \"average\" wave:\n\n$$\nv_{av} = \\frac{\\omega_{av}}{k_{av}}\n$$\n\nThe phase velocity of the envelope:\n\n$$\nv_{env} = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\Delta k}\n$$\n\nIn a *non-dispersive* medium (*i.e.* all frequencies travel with the same phase velocity), it can be shown that $v_{\\textsf{av}} = v_{\\textsf{env}} = \\frac{\\omega_1}{k_1} = \\frac{\\omega_2}{k_2} =$ the phase velocity of the medium.\n\nHowever, in a dispersive medium, the velocities are not equal, *i.e.* $v_{av} \\neq v_{env}$, and the \"envelope\" propagates at a different speed to the individual components.

This leads to waves travelling in both directions which combine by superposition.  Only certain frequencies can exist in a standing wave, as the superposition leads to a stationary pattern called a **standing wave**.\n\n## Wave function for a standing wave {#sec-ch10-standingwaves2}\n\nIn order to fully consider a standing wave, we need to derive the form of its wavefunction.  To do this, we consider two waves travelling in opposite directions along a string (@eq-ch10-standingwaves1). Because one is a reflection of the other (they each reflect from the boundaries), they will have the same frequency and phase.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_1 &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t) \\\\\ny_2 &=& y_0 \\sin (kx + \\omega t) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-standingwaves1}\n\nThe resultant vertical displacement of the string is then the sum of these two waves (@eq-ch10-standingwaves2):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny &=& y_1 + y_2 \\\\\ny &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t) + y_0 \\sin (kx + \\omega t) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-standingwaves2}\n\nWe can add these directly using a trigonometric identify or we can work in the complex notation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t) + y_0 \\sin (kx + \\omega t) \\\\\n &=& y_0 \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}(kx - \\omega t)} + y_0 \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}(kx + \\omega t)} \\\\\n &=& y_0 \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}kx} \\left( \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\omega t} + \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t} \\right)\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-standingwaves3}\n\nWe can use either an Argand diagram or De Moivre's theorem to show that the term $\\left( \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}+ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t} \\right) = 2 \\cos \\omega t$, and hence:\n\n$$\ny = 2 y_0 \\cos \\omega t \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}kx}\n$$\n\nWe can now expand the complex exponent using De Moivre's theorem again and, remembering we are interested in the 'imaginary' component (as this contains the desired sine function), and we obtain the result in @eq-ch10-standingwaves4:\n\n$$\ny = \\underbrace{2 y_0 \\cos \\omega t}_{\\textsf{time-dependent amplitude}} \\underbrace{\\sin kx}_{\\textsf{static wave}}\n$${#eq-ch10-standingwaves4}\n\nThis result describes a static wave, $y = \\sin kx$ whose amplitude varies in time as $A = 2 y_0 \\cos \\omega t$.

Any string will resonate with maximum amplitude when excited with these frequencies, and this set of harmonics are known as a harmonic series.  The actual harmonics heard when the string is excited will depend on the manner of its excitation; *e.g.* a string plucked at its centre will *only* display the odd harmonics; *i.e.* those with an anti-node in the centre.\n\nIn stringed instruments (violin, piano, guitar etc.) the vibration of the string is amplified by a mechanical resonator; a soundboard in the case of the piano, or resonant cavities for a guitar or violin.  These resonators must be carefully designed to resonate equally well over a wide range of frequencies.\n\n## Organ pipes and other wind instruments {#sec-ch10-pipesandwindinstruments}\n\nIn contrast to a vibrating string, wind instruments rely on a resonance within a column of air.  We can model these pipes as a simple pipe, resonating at its natural frequencies when air is blown into (or across) an opening at one end.  The resonant behaviour will differ depending on whether the other end of the pipe is open or closed.  We will consider each of these cases in turn.\n\n### Pipes open at both ends\n\nIn this model, the column of air is able to vibrate at its ends, so we have a similar set of harmonics as for a string, but with displacement antinodes at its ends (the air can vibrate freely at the ends of the tube).  There is a second set of nodes/antinodes corresponding to the pressure; these do not align with the displacement nodes/antinodes; rather a **pressure node** aligns with a **displacement antinode** and vice versa. (if an air molecule does not move, we have a displacement node, but it is continuously 'squashed' from both sides by the oscillating air molecules, so experiences the biggest pressure change).\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, ch10-waves-closedtube, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.align=\"center\", auto_pdf=TRUE, fig.cap=\"This image shows the node/antinode structure of a standing wave in a **closed tube**.
