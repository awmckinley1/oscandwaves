We can go further than this, and specify general expressions which can satisfy the wave equation.  \n\nSpecifically, if we have two functions, $y_1$ and $y_2$ (@eq-ch10-superposition1), which satisfy the wave equation, then their sum (@eq-ch10-superposition2), including scaling constants $C_1$ and $C_2$) must also satisfy the wave equation.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_1 &=& A_1 \\sin\\left[k_1(x \\pm vt)\\right] \\\\\ny_2 &=& A_2 \\sin\\left[k_2(x \\pm vt)\\right] \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-superposition1}\n\n\n$$\ny_3 = C_1 y_1 + C_2 y_2\n$${#eq-ch10-superposition2}\n\nUsing double angle formulae we can demonstrate that $y_3$ can also be written in the form $y = f(x \\pm vt)$, thus satisfying the wave equation.^[When including scaling factors, this can become less than trivial, but can still be done.] Therefore, the new wave $y_3$ is a linear superposition of the original waves $y_1$ and $y_2$.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the wave equation was derived in the case of small amplitude disturbances; therefore if the vibration amplitudes become too large, the principle of superposition may fail.  This can lead to some very interesting effects, including **non-linear optics**^[Related to the non-linear response of the electromagnetic interactions with the medium, rather than light travelling in straight lines!]\n\n## Two waves with same amplitude and frequency {#sec-ch10-identicalwaves1}\n\nLet's now consider two waves with the same amplitude and frequency; but differing in phase (@eq-ch10-superposition3):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_1 &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t) \\\\\ny_2 &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t +\\delta ) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-superposition3}\n\nIf the two waves are superimposed, for example if they are travelling through the same medium, the resultant wavefunction is just the sum of $y_1$ and $y_2$ (@eq-ch10-superposition4):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny &=& y_1 + y_2 \\\\\n  &=& y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t) + y_0 \\sin (kx - \\omega t +\\delta )\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-superposition4}\n\nIn many situations it is mathematically simpler to use the complex exponential notation to treat waves and oscillations.

If $\\delta = 0$, the waves are exactly in phase and the waves add together (constructive interference), with amplitude $A = 2 y_0$;\n1. If $\\delta = \\pi$, the waves are exactly out of phase and the waves subtract (destructive interference), and the amplitude $A = 0$;\n1. If $\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, the resultant wave has exactly the same amplitude as the input waves.\n\nAll three of these cases can be derived by substituting the relevant value of $\\delta$ into @eq-ch10-superposition5c).\n\n### Phasors {#sec-ch10-phasors1}\n\nThe process we have shown above is a specific case of using *phasors* to determine an amplitude of a superposition of waves.  The general method for determining the superposition of a number of waves of the same frequency - regardless of amplitude or relative phase - is shown as follows.\n\nFor a series of waves (@eq-ch10-generalwaves1), each with its own amplitude $A_n$ and relative phase $\\delta_n$, we can determine a superposition by summing them together.\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\ny_1 = A_1 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_1)} \\\\\ny_2 = A_2 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_2)} \\\\\ny_3 = A_3 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_3)} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n$${#eq-ch10-generalwaves1}\n\n\nThe summation is straightforward:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_{\\mathrm{total}} &=&  y_1 + y_2 + y_3 \\\\\n&=& A_1 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_1)} + A_2 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_2)} + A_3 e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta_3)}\\\\\n&=& \\left(A_1 e^{i\\delta_1} + A_2 e^{i\\delta_2} + A_3 e^{i\\delta_3} \\right) e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch10-generalwaves2}\n\nBy taking out a common factor of $e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}$ from the superposition, we have isolated the variable \"wave component\" ($e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}$) from the invariant (constant) component, ($\\left(A_1 e^{i\\delta_1} + A_2 e^{i\\delta_2} + A_3 e^{i\\delta_3} \\right)$).  This 'invariant' component is the amplitude of the new superposition, and thus we have expressed our superposition as the original wave - with a 'zero phase' offset - and an amplitude.\n\nAs the new amplitude is a sum of complex numbers, we can visualise these on an Argand diagram (@fig-ch10-argand-phasors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" auto_pdf='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The amplitude component of a wave superposition can be represented on an Argand diagram, where the total amplitude can be determined as the resultant of the sum of the complex amplitudes.](visualisations/LaTeX/ch10-argand-phasors.svg){#fig-ch10-argand-phasors fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method will work for any values of $\\delta$ and any amplitudes $A$, provided the frequency $\\omega$ and wavenumber $k$ of the superposed waves is constant.\n\n## Two waves, same amplitude, different frequency (Beats) {#sec-ch10-differentwaves1}\n\nLet's consider two waves with the same amplitude but differing in frequency (*i.e.* amplitude $y_0$ is common to both, each has independent frequency $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega 2$).

This leads to waves travelling in both directions which combine by superposition.  Only certain frequencies can exist in a standing wave, as the superposition leads to a stationary pattern called a **standing wave**.\n\n## Wave function for a standing wave {#sec-ch10-standingwaves2}\n\nIn order to fully consider a standing wave, we need to derive the form of its wavefunction.  To do this, we consider two waves travelling in opposite directions along a string (@eq-ch10-standingwaves1).

The resonant behaviour will differ depending on whether the other end of the pipe is open or closed.  We will consider each of these cases in turn.\n\n### Pipes open at both ends\n\nIn this model, the column of air is able to vibrate at its ends, so we have a similar set of harmonics as for a string, but with displacement antinodes at its ends (the air can vibrate freely at the ends of the tube).  There is a second set of nodes/antinodes corresponding to the pressure; these do not align with the displacement nodes/antinodes; rather a **pressure node** aligns with a **displacement antinode** and vice versa.
