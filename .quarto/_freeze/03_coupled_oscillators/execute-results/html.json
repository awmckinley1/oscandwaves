This is known as a 'coupled oscillator'.  A typical example of a coupled oscillator is shown in @fig-ch3-blocksonspring3 below; a pair of oscillating masses on springs which are linked by a further spring. An alternative model uses two simple pendulums, connected by a coupling spring. In either case, the mathematics is similar.\n\n\nFor the purposes of discussion here, we will consider the example of two linked masses. This ostensibly keeps the mathematics simpler, however through a simple substitution it is readily adapted for the case of the linked pendulums.\n\n## The uncoupled example {#sec-ch3-uncoupledosc-1}\n\nConsider two masses oscillating on a smooth plane  as shown in @fig-ch3-blocksonspring1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" auto_pdf='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two masses, $m_A$ and $m_B$ oscillating on a frictionless surface.

Put simply; there are two forces acting on each mass to control their oscillations; the force from its original spring ($F_A$ or $F_B$), and the new force from the coupling spring, $F_{AB}$.\n\nFrom @fig-ch3-blocksonspring3 we can see that the overall extension of the coupling spring, $\\delta$ will be given by:\n\n$$\n\\delta = x_B - x_A\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledspringextension1}\n\nThe appearance of the negative sign in @eq-ch3-coupledspringextension1 initially appears counter-intuitive, however consider the signs on each of the extensions in reference to the arbitrary 'positive' direction we defined earlier:\n\n* If $x_B = x_A$, there will be no extension; so no force will be applied from the coupling spring\n* In the diagram above, $x_A$ is negative; this gives a double-negative in @eq-ch3-coupledspringextension1, with a positive value of $\\delta$ (a stretched spring)\n* However, if $x_A$ is sufficiently positive, it will result in a negative value of $\\delta$, indicating a compressed spring.\n\nYou may find it helpful to draw sketches of each of these situations to reason it through!\n\nOk, let's first consider the total force acting on mass $A$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nF_{\\mathrm{Total, }A} &=& F_A + F_{AB} \\\\\n&=& -k_A x_A + k_{AB}(\\delta) \\\\\n&=& -k_A x_A + k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) \\\\\n&=& m_A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledosc1a}\n\nWe can reason the direction of the force $F_{AB}$ from a sketch; if the coupling spring is stretched (positive $\\delta$), the force will be in the positive direction. If the coupling spring is compressed (negative $\\delta$) the force will be in the negative direction.\n\nThis situation changes slightly for mass $B$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nF_{\\mathrm{Total, }B} &=& F_B - F_{AB} \\\\\n&=& -k_B x_B - k_{AB}(\\delta) \\\\\n&=& -k_B x_B - k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) \\\\\n&=& m_B \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledosc1b}\n\nIn this case, a stretched coupling spring (positive $\\delta$) will cause a force in the negative direction and *vice versa*.\n\nWe have therefore generated two equations of motion to describe the coupled oscillator:\n\n$$\n-k_A x_A + k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) = m_A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-1a}\n\nand\n\n$$\n-k_B x_B - k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) = m_B \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-1b}\n\n## Simplifying the expressions {#sec-ch3-simplifying-expressions}\n\nWe know from instinct that the motion of a component in a coupled oscillator **should** be harmonic in nature, however it is not immediately clear from the equations that this is the case; therefore some simplification is in order.\n\nFirstly, let's add together @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-1a and @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-1b:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nm_A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + m_B \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &=& -k_A x_A -k_B x_B + k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) \\\\ & & \\quad  - k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) \\\\\n&=& -k_A x_A -k_B x_B\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-2a}\n\n**If** the spring constants $k_A$ and $k_B$ are equal, and the masses $m_A$ and $m_B$ are equal, we can simplify further:\n\n$$\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 (x_A +x_B)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -k (x_A + x_B)\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-2b}\n\nWe can gain a second expression to describe our coupled system by subtracting @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-1b from @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-1a:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nm_A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} - m_B \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &=& -k_A x_A + k_B x_B + k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) \\\\ & & \\quad + k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) \\\\\n&=& -k_A x_A + k_B x_B + 2 k_{AB}(x_B - x_A)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-3a}\n\nAgain, **if** the spring constants $k_A$ and $k_B$ are equal, and the masses $m_A$ and $m_B$ are equal, we can again simplify further:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 (x_A -x_B)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &=& -k(x_A - x_B)  - 2k_{AB}(x_A - x_B) \\\\\n&=& -(k + 2k_{AB})(x_A - x_B)\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-3b}\n\nThis does not immediately appear to simplify the situation, however if we now define two variables, $y_1$ and $y_2$ (we use numerical subscripts now to eliminate confusion with the alphabetical labels of the oscillating masses):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_1 &=& x_A + x_B \\\\\ny_2 &=& x_A - x_B\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-xtoyconvert-1}\n\nwe can now do a substitution into @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-2b and @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-3b:\n\n@eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-2b becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 (x_A +x_B)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &=& -k (x_A + x_B) \\\\\n\\\\\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y_1}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &=& -k y_1\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-4a}\n\n...while @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-3b becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 (x_A -x_B)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &=& -(k + 2k_{AB})(x_A - x_B) \\\\\n\\\\\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y_2}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &=& -(k + 2k_{AB})y_2\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-4b}\n\nNow we have two equations, @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-4a and @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-4b, each of which is far simpler than the solutions in $x$, and each satisfies a harmonic oscillator condition in $y_n$.

However, we can now use the same techniques as in @eq-test1 and @eq-shm-general-omega1 to obtain expressions for the frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ (@eq-ch3-coupledsolution-2):\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\omega_1 &=& \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{m}} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\omega_2 &=& \\sqrt{\\dfrac{(k+2k_{AB})}{m}}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledsolution-2}\n\nWe can now return to equations @eq-ch3-xtoyconvert-1 to return our expressions in $y$ to the displacement $x$ of each oscillating mass.  Firstly, invert the equations shown in @eq-ch3-xtoyconvert-1 to obtain the results shown in @eq-ch3-xtoyconvert-2:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_A &=& y_1 - x_B \\\\\n  &=& y_2 + x_B\\\\\n  &=& \\frac{1}{2} y_1 + \\frac{1}{2}y_2 \\\\\n\\\\\nx_B &=& y_1 - x_A \\\\\n  &=& y_2 + x_A\\\\\n  &=& \\frac{1}{2} y_1 - \\frac{1}{2}y_2\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-xtoyconvert-2}\n\n## Solving the coupled oscillator\n\nWe can now use the general results from @eq-ch3-coupledsolution-1 to give the coupled solutions @eq-ch3-coupledsolution-3:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_1 &= & \\frac{1}{2} B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\phi_1) + \\frac{1}{2}B_2 \\cos (\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2)\\\\\nx_2 &=& \\frac{1}{2} B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\phi_1) - \\frac{1}{2}B_2 \\cos (\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledsolution-3}\n\nRecalling our angle formulae, we know that we can express the term $B \\cos (\\omega t + \\phi)$ as $C \\cos (\\omega t) + D \\sin(\\omega t)$, where the new constants $C$ and $D$ are a combination of the original constant $B$ and either $\\cos \\phi$ or $\\sin \\phi$ (ensure you can identify where this comes from!).  This can be used to give a full general solution as:\n\n$$ \n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{l}\nx_1 = C_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t) + D_1 \\sin(\\omega_1 t) + C_2 \\cos(\\omega_2 t) + D_2 \\sin(\\omega_2 t) \\\\\nx_2 = C_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t) + D_1 \\sin(\\omega_1 t) - C_2 \\cos(\\omega_2 t) - D_2 \\sin(\\omega_2 t)\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledsolution-4}\n\nThis full solution is more helpful to us if we wish to consider initial conditions of the system (e.g. $x_1 (0)$, $v_1 (0)$ etc.). \n\n## Normal coordinates\n\nBut where are the practicalities of all this? So far, we have done a lot of mathematical manipulation to arrive at two coupled equations (@eq-ch3-coupledsolution-4) which, while they ostensibly describe the position of two coupled oscillating masses, still remain frustratingly abstract!  It is helpful to return to the 'simple' expressions in @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-4a and @eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-4b:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y_1}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = -k y_1 \\\\\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y_2}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = -(k+ 2k_{AB}) y_2 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-coupledoscillator-4c}\n\nThese underlying 'natural variables', $y_1$ and $y_2$, are much simpler to consider and work with, and we therefore call these variables \"**normal coordinates**\", as it is simpler to work with these directly, and then return to displacement/velocity/acceleration coordinates of the system.  It also helps us to visualise what is happening within the system.  To do this, we will take the two extreme situations - when $x_A = x_B$, and when $x_A = -x_B$.\n\nIt is helpful to have the following on hand:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_1 &=& x_A + x_B \\\\\ny_2 &=& x_A - x_B\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n### When $x_A = x_B$\n\nIn this situation, $y_1 = 2x$, and $y_2 = 0$. From equation @eq-ch3-coupledsolution-3, the $y_2$ term reduces to zero, and we have the displacements for each oscillator as @eq-ch3-extremesolution-1:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_1 &= & \\frac{1}{2} B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\phi_1) \\\\\nx_2 &=& \\frac{1}{2} B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\phi_1) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-extremesolution-1}\n\nWe can see from the mathematics that the displacement of each mass from its equilibrium point is identical, however it is often helpful to visualise this motion.  In this case, the mid-point between the masses may be considered to be moving in concert with the two masses (@fig-ch3-xa_equals_xb):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" auto_pdf='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![When the initial displacement of each oscillator is identical, the coupling spring is neither stretched nor compressed, so has no effect on the oscillation period of each oscillator.

Therefore each mass may be considered to be oscillating exactly in phase and only under the influence of its spring, $k$. We would expect therefore the oscillation frequency to match that of the uncoupled oscillators introduced in @sec-ch3-uncoupledosc-1. \n\n### When $x_A = - x_B$\n\nThis is the exact opposite situation to that discussed above. In this situation, $y_1 = 0$, and $y_2 = 2x$.  As it is the $y_0$ term which is now reduced to zero in @eq-ch3-coupledsolution-3, this expression reduces to @eq-ch3-extremesolution-2:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_1 &= & \\frac{1}{2} B_2 \\cos(\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2) \\\\\nx_2 &=& - \\frac{1}{2} B_2 \\cos(\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-extremesolution-2}\n\nNow we have a symmetry; at any stage of motion, mass $A$ will be displaced by the same amount as mass $B$ *in the opposite direction*. The consequence of this now is that the mid-point between the masses now does **not** move as the masses oscillate, and can be considered a *node* (@fig-ch3-xa_equals_minusxb).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" auto_pdf='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![When the initial displacement of each oscillator is identical but opposite, the coupling spring is either fully stretched or fully compressed.

One particular case occurs when a vibration is initiated with one mass in its equilibrium position and only the other mass is disturbed.

In this case, we will apply this to determine the frequencies for a coupled oscillator and check with our results above.\n\nWe already seen the end result, that $D \\bar{A} = \\omega^2 \\bar{A}$, having constructed this assuming a single oscillation frequency. But how does this scale, particularly as we said earlier that we expect *two* frequencies, one from each vibrational mode?\n\n::: callout-tip\n### A refresher on eigenvalue equations\n\nFor an eigenvalue equation, an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ will have $n$ eigenvalues ($\\lambda_i$) and $n$ eigenvectors $\\bar{x}_i$ such that:\n\n$$\nA \\bar{x}_i = \\lambda_i \\bar{x}_i\n$$\nTo find our eigenvalues, we need to rearrange and solve for $\\lambda_i$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nA \\bar{x}_i - \\lambda_i \\bar{x}_i &=& 0 \\\\\nA \\bar{x}_i - \\lambda_i \\mathbf{I} \\bar{x}_i &=& 0 \\\\\n(A - \\lambda_i \\mathbf{I}) \\bar{x}_i &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nRemember that we need to multiply $\\lambda_i$ by the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$ because we cannot perform addition/subtraction on matrices of different dimensions.\n\nWe can now solve the eigenvalue equation; either $\\bar{x}_i = 0$ (a null result), or the determinant of the matrix $|A - \\lambda_i \\mathbf{I}| = 0$.  Evaluating this determinant will give the characteristic polynomial which, when solved for $\\lambda_i$, will give the eigenvalues for the equation.\n:::\n\nWe start with our eigenvalue equation, and we can rearrange this to obtain an expression which will allow us to evaluate the eigenvalue (@eq-ch3-findeigenvalue-1).\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nD \\bar{A} &=& \\omega^2 \\bar{A}\\\\\nD \\bar{A} - \\omega^2 \\bar{A} &=& 0 \\\\\nD \\bar{A} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{I} \\bar{A} &=& 0 \\\\\n(D - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{I}) \\bar{A} &=& 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$${#eq-ch3-findeigenvalue-1}\n\nFrom this statement, either $\\bar{A}$ is equal to zero, or the determinant of the matrix $(D - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{I})$ is equal to zero. Clearly we use this second result to determine the value of the eigenvalue, $\\omega^2$.\n\nRemembering from @sec-ch3-generalsolution-matrix we defined $D$ as the **dynamics matrix** derived from the inverse of the 'mass matrix' and the 'spring matrix' such that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nD = M^{-1}K &= &\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{1}{m_A} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{m_B}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n(k_A + k_{AB}) & -k_{AB} \\\\\n-k_{AB} & (k_B + k_{AB})\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\\\\\n&=&\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{k_A + k_{AB}}{m_A} & -\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_A} \\\\\n-\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_B} & \\frac{k_B + k_{AB}}{m_B}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-findeigenvalue-2}\n\n\nNow, we set up the matrix form of our eigenvalue equation from @eq-ch3-findeigenvalue-1; remembering that we are looking for the eigenvalues which result in a determinant of zero.  Let's work it through!\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n(D - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{I}) \\bar{A} &=& 0 \\\\\n\\mathrm{det}\\left[ \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{k_A + k_{AB}}{m_A} & -\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_A} \\\\\n-\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_B} & \\frac{k_B + k_{AB}}{m_B}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n- \\omega^2\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1&0\\\\\n0&1\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right) \\right] &=& 0 \\\\\n\\mathrm{det}\n\\left[ \n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\left(\\frac{ k_A + k_{AB}}{m_A} \\right)-\\omega^2 & -\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_A} \\\\\n-\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_B} & \\left(\\frac{k_B + k_{AB}}{m_B}\\right)-\\omega^2\n\\end{array}\n\\right] &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-findeigenvalue-3}\n\nWe will simplify the arrangement somewhat by considering the coupled oscillator we have been examining above; where the local springs $k_A$ and $k_B$ have the same spring constant, $k$, and the oscillators $A$ and $B$ have the same mass, $m$.  Our determinant then becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\mathrm{det}\n\\left[ \n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\left(\\frac{ k + k_{AB}}{m} \\right)-\\omega^2 & -\\frac{k_{AB}}{m} \\\\\n-\\frac{k_{AB}}{m} & \\left(\\frac{k + k_{AB}}{m}\\right)-\\omega^2\n\\end{array}\n\\right] &=& 0 \\\\\n\\left[\\left(\\frac{ k + k_{AB}}{m} \\right) - \\omega^2 \\right]^2 - \\frac{k_{AB}^2}{m^2} &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-findeigenvalue-4}\n\nThis relation is now a quadratic in $\\omega^2$; as such, it will have two solutions - each corresponding to a different value of $\\omega$ - this is what we are expecting - to find $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ above. So we solve for $\\omega^2$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\left[\\left(\\frac{ k + k_{AB}}{m} \\right) - \\omega^2 \\right]^2 - \\frac{k_{AB}^2}{m^2} &=& 0 \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{ k + k_{AB}}{m} \\right) - \\omega^2 &=& \\pm \\frac{k_{AB}}{m} \\\\\nk + k_{AB} - m\\omega^2 &=& \\pm k_{AB} \\\\\nm\\omega^2 &=& \\mp k_{AB} + (k+k_{AB}) \\\\\n\\\\\n\\omega^2 = \\dfrac{k}{m} &\\mathsf{or}& \\omega^2 = \\dfrac{2k_{AB} + k}{m}\n\\end{array}\n$$ {#eq-ch3-findeigenvalue-5}\n\nAs we can see in @eq-ch3-findeigenvalue-5 we gain a result for $\\omega^2$ which gives us the two solutions for $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ which we uncovered in @sec-ch3-simplifying-expressions and @sec-ch3-backtodisplacement1.\n\n::: callout-caution\n\nRemember the frequencies that we have found here correspond to the frequencies of the **normal modes of vibration of the system** (@sec-ch3-application-normal-coords). They are used to describe the motion of individual oscillating masses, but both frequencies apply to each oscillating mass - *not* one frequency for each mass!\n\n:::\n\n## Why use matrices?\n\nWe have shown a few routes to look at coupled oscillators, each of which we have demonstrated to lead to the same outcome.  The obvious question is **why** use so many approaches?\n\nWhen we looked at the separate differential equations, it was a problem which is possible to solve here for two coupled oscillators, however it is not a method which is particularly scalable, for either different masses, different spring constants, or even a larger number of coupling oscillators. \n\nThe matrix approach however is scalable - it is simple in its form allowing us to see the nature of the oscillation and that it is - at its heart - still harmonic, however this simple form will scale readily for larger systems.  We could look at a system of five linearly coupled oscillators, and we would expect a $5\\times 5$ spring (and hence dynamics) matrix, the determinant of which would be a fifth order polynomial with five solutions for the oscillation frequency, each corresponding to the frequency of a normal mode of vibration for the system.\n\nSolving a determinant for a $3\\times 3$ matrix by hand is doable, for a $4\\times 4$ matrix is troublesome, and a $5 \\times 5$ matrix is downright inconvenient.  However, computers are *excellent* at resolving determinants of matrices - making solving such problems possible - provided we know what instructions to give the computer!\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Applications of matrix methods\n\nMatrices are universal in physics, and it is hard to understate the importance of solving eigenvalue equations. Linear algebra is central to quantum physics, and greatly simplifies the process of solving complex interlinked systems.  The methods shown above are simply one application of the techniques. \n:::",
