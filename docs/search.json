It can be thought of as the angular frequency, with units radians s-1, and an oscillation of \\(2\\pi\\) radians corresponds to one period of oscillation.\nAdditionally, since the frequency of the oscillation \\(f\\) is the reciprocal of the period of oscillation (\\(f = \\frac{1}{T}\\)), the angular frequency can be rewritten as \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\), and \\(f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}\\).\nFor the spring system we discussed in Section 1.1, we stated that the angular frequency \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\). Therefore we can obtain an expression for the frequency of our oscillator (Equation 1.13):\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\n\\tag{1.13}\\] Inspection of this equation reveals the behaviour of our oscillator:\n\nIf we have a stiffer spring (larger \\(k\\)), we expect the frequency \\(f\\) to increase,\nIf we use an oscillator with larger mass (larger \\(m\\)), we would expect the frequency (\\(f\\)) to decrease.\nThe frequency (and therefore period) of simple harmonic oscillation is independent of amplitude.2"

    "text": "1.10 SHM in Real Systems\nTextbook link: Tipler and Mosca: Ch 14.2 to 14.4\nWe will now go on to look at some applications of SHM in real-world systems.\n\n1.10.1 General motion near equilibrium\nA way of thinking about SHM is that it is a point mass oscillating within a potential energy field. As with any potential energy field, the force on this particle is given by the gradient of the potential energy and is directed down the potential energy slope. Mathematically, for a potential energy field, the force may be found as follows (Equation 1.19):\n\\[\nF = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}r}\n\\tag{1.19}\\]\nIn a one-dimensional system, this is expressed as follows (Equation 1.20):\n\\[\nF_x = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}x}\n\\tag{1.20}\\]\nAs mentioned in Section 1.1, under SHM the force is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and in the opposite direction; i.e.:\n\\[\nF_x = -kx\n\\tag{1.21}\\]\nApplying the principle from Equation 1.19 we can therefore integrate this experession with respect to \\(x\\) to obtain the expression for our potential energy. We covered this in Section 1.9, and we found the result (Equation 1.22); remember that, due to initial conditions, the constant of integration reduces to zero).\n\\[\nU  = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\\tag{1.22}\\]\nSimple inspection and recall of our mathematics knowledge tells us that this simple equation represents a parabola.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome useful points on the harmonic oscillator\n\n\n\n\nA parabolic potential energy function implies SHM and vice versa;\nFor small amplitudes of oscillation, many potential energy functions may be approximated by a parabola (e.g. a pendulum, vibrating molecules)\nA system undergoing SHM is called a harmonic oscillator.\n\n\n\nThe simplicity of the simple harmonic oscillator model is what makes it such a generally useful system to consider.\n\n\n1.10.2 Example: a diatomic molecule\nA diatomic molecule is a useful system to consider as an example because it can be approximated to a harmonic oscillator at small displacements about the equilibrium. The potential energy curve for a vibrating diatomic molecule (in this case the H2 hydrogen molecule) is shown in Figure 1.6.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Comparing the Morse potential of the anharmonic oscillator with the harmonic approximation. Near equilibrium, the harmonic oscillator model approximates diatomic behaviour, however this rapidly deviates from reality.\n\n\n\n\nThe potential of a vibrating diatomic is known as the Morse potential; the form of this is outwith this discussion, however it is useful to think that, for small displacements around the equilibrium separation the potential energy curve approximates a parabola. We can therefore re-draw our potential energy curve as such, and show this in Figure Figure 1.7).4\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: The parabolic approximation of a diatomic molecule, showing the potential varying with compression or extension from equilibrium separation, \\(r_0\\).\n\n\n\n\nThe equation of the parabola shown in Figure 1.7 takes the following form:\n\\[\nU(r) = A + B(r - r_0)^2\n\\tag{1.23}\\] …where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants relating to the molecular system under consideration, and \\(r_0\\) is the equilibrium bond length.\nThe force on the bond can then be found from the first derivative of the bond potential described in Equation 1.23:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nF_r &=& - \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}r} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=& -2B(r-r_0)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{1.24}\\]\nSince the term \\((r-r_0)\\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position, we see that the force, \\(F_r\\) is a restoring force and is proportional to the displacement (and in the opposite direction!), telling us that the motion is SHM. In this example however, the parabolic approximation fails at larger amplitudes.\n\n\n1.10.3 Example: Mass on a vertical spring\nIn Section 1.1 we considered a mass on a horizontal spring; there was only a single force acting on the mass (the force from the spring), however we are now considering a vertical spring and must consider the effects of gravity (Figure 1.8).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: A particle oscillating on a vertical spring. There are two equilibrium positions corresponding to the equilibrium position of the unladen spring (a) and the equilibrium position of the mass loaded on spring (b), where the weight of the load is balanced by the force from the extended spring.\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we need to work through a slightly different process to find the equation of motion, chiefly because the equilibrium displacement of the mass (\\(y_0\\)) is different from the equilibrium position of the spring.\nThe equilibrium position of the mass \\(y_0\\) is lower than the equilibrium extension of the spring (gravity on the mass causes the spring to stretch). This is found by relating the force from the spring and the force of gravity acting on the mass (Equation 1.25):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\mathrm{Force~due~to~spring~extension} &=& \\mathrm{Gravity~acting~on~mass}\\\\\nk y_0 &=& mg\\\\\ny_0 &=& \\dfrac{mg}{k}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{1.25}\\]\nWe now apply the Second Law of motion to obtain an expression for the acceleration on the mass due to the forces acting on it (the spring force and gravity).\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nm\\ddot{y}&=&  \\textrm{spring force} + \\textrm{gravity} \\\\\nm\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} &=& -ky + mg\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{1.26}\\] In this expression, \\(y\\) is the total extension of the spring (the extension to the mass equilibrium point, \\(y_0\\) plus the displacement from this point, \\(y^\\prime\\)).\nWe now substitute a variable; since \\(y = y_0 + y^\\prime\\), we substitute \\(y\\) for \\(y^\\prime\\):\n\n\\(y = y_0 + y^\\prime\\)\n\\(y^\\prime = y - y_0\\)\n\nSince \\(y_0\\) is a constant:\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d} y^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\hspace{10pt} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10pt} \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d} t^2}\n\\] Replacing \\(y\\) for \\((y_0 + y^\\prime)\\) in Equation 1.26, we obtain Equation 1.27:\n\\[\nm\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = -k(y_0 + y^\\prime) + mg\n\\tag{1.27}\\] Since \\(ky_0 = mg\\) (Equation 1.25), we can therefore eliminate these terms from Equation 1.27, and rewrite as Equation 1.28):\n\\[\nm\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y^\\prime}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = -k y^\\prime\n\\tag{1.28}\\]\nThis means that, in reference to Figure 1.8, we still have SHM centered on the equilibrium position of the mass. This may seem like a self-evident result, however it is useful to recognise the role of gravity; its effect is to shift the equilibrium position of the oscillation from \\(y = 0\\) (the equilibrium position of the spring) to \\(y = y_0\\) (\\(y^\\prime = 0\\)).\nLet’s now consider the energy in this system. The system already contains some elastic energy as the spring is already stretched to \\(y_0\\) by the gravity acting on the mass:\n\\[\n\\textrm{elastic potential energy} = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 - \\frac{1}{2}ky_0^2\n\\] The gravitational potential energy (relative to the starting position \\(y_0\\)) is given by:\n\\[\n\\textrm{gravitational potential energy} = mg(y-y_0)\n\\] The total potential energy is therefore given by Equation 1.29:\n\\[\nU = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 - \\frac{1}{2}ky_0^2 - mg(y-y_0)\n\\tag{1.29}\\]\nWe can then show that the total potential energy expression in Equation 1.29 can be simplified to that shown in Equation Equation 1.30:\n\\[\nU = \\frac{1}{2} ky^{\\prime 2}\n\\tag{1.30}\\] You should ensure you understand how this simplification is done; this is left as an exercise.5\nOverall, the expression for the total potential energy shown in Equation 1.30 will still yield a parabola and as such the oscillation is still a simple harmonic oscillation as before."

Firstly, let’s make a couple of assumptions:\n\nThe amplitude of the damped oscillation is subject to an exponential decay over a timescale of \\(2\\tau\\) (don’t worry about the factor of 2 for now), and\nThe damped oscillation has a frequency \\(\\omega^\\prime\\) which may be different from the natural frequency of the undamped oscillator, \\(\\omega_0\\).\n\nOur exponential decay factor then becomes \\(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{t}{2\\tau}}\\), and the exponential form of the wave equation becomes \\(\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}(\\omega^\\prime t + \\delta)}\\) (combination of Equation 1.5 and Equation 12.11).

Remember that Equation 3.8 expands via De Moivre’s theorem to:\n\\[\nA_0 = -A \\left( \\cos \\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right) + \\mathrm{i} \\sin \\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right)  \\right)\n\\tag{3.9}\\]\nThe imaginary component of Equation 3.9 reduces to zero (the solution, \\(A_0\\) is fully real):\n\\[\n0 = -A \\sin \\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right)\n\\]\nWe can therefore relate \\(\\delta\\) and \\(\\delta^\\prime\\) as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\delta + \\delta^\\prime = \\pi & \\textit{i.e.} & \\delta^\\prime = \\pi - \\delta\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{3.10}\\]\nWe now examine the ‘real’ component of Equation 3.9, equal to \\(A_0\\):\n\\[\nA_0 = - A \\cos \\left( \\delta + \\delta^\\prime \\right)\n\\]\n…and doing the same analysis, now that we know that, under our initial conditions, \\(\\delta + \\delta^\\prime = \\pi\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nA_0 = -A \\cos \\pi & \\textit{i.e.} & A_0 = A\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{3.11}\\]\nWe can now revisit Equation 3.7, now that we have values for \\(\\delta\\), \\(\\delta^\\prime\\) and \\(A_0\\) under our starting conditions ( \\(x = 0\\) when \\(t = 0\\)):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx &= & A \\left[ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}  + \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t + \\delta^\\prime \\right)} \\right]\\\\\n&= & A \\left[ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}  + \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t + \\pi - \\delta \\right)} \\right]\\\\\n&= & A \\left[ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}  + \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t - \\delta \\right)} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\pi} \\right]\\\\\n&= & A \\left[ \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(\\omega t - \\delta \\right)}  - \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\omega^\\prime t - \\delta \\right)}  \\right]\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{3.12}\\]\nFinally, we can find the actual displacement of the oscillator by examining the real component of Equation 3.12, summarised in Equation 3.13):\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Re}(x) = A \\left[ \\cos (\\omega t - \\delta) - \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t} \\cos (\\omega^\\prime t - \\delta) \\right]\n\\tag{3.13}\\]\nWe can visualise the amplitude of a forced oscillator, as shown in Figure 3.3. At very low frequencies, the oscillation has the same amplitude as the driving oscillation. This rapidly increases under resonance to a peak, but then drops rapidly to a value towards zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The amplitude of a forced oscillation varies with driving frequency; close to the driving amplitude at very low frequencies, close to zero at very high frequencies, with a peak occurring under resonant conditions. Note that the position of this peak varies with the damping coefficient \\(b\\).\n\n\n\n\nNote that the position of the resonant peak amplitude also varies with the damping coefficient \\(b\\).\n\n3.4.1 Special cases of forced oscillations\nThere are three special cases of forced oscillations to consider:\n\n\\(\\omega \\ll \\omega_0\\)\n\\(\\omega \\gg \\omega_0\\)\n\\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: When the frequency of the driving oscillation \\(\\omega\\) is very different to the natural frequency of the system we see two regimes; firstly, where \\(\\omega \\ll \\omega_0\\) (blue), the natural frequency decays and we are left to observe the driving frequency at a large amplitude; when \\(\\omega \\gg \\omega_0\\) (orange), we see a much smaller amplitude oscillation at close to the driving frequency.\n\n\n\n\nIn the special case when \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) and the damping coefficient \\(b\\) is small (allowing the damped frequency \\(\\omega^\\prime\\) to be approximately equal to the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\)), we can rewrite the expression of the displacement (Equation 3.13) as shown in Equation 3.14:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Re}(x) = A  \\cos (\\omega_0 t - \\delta) \\left[ 1 - \\mathrm{e}^{- \\left(\\frac{b}{2m}\\right)t}  \\right]\n\\tag{3.14}\\]\nWe can see that the oscillation will converge to a maximum value, at which point the energy put into the system becomes equal to the energy dissipated by the system through damping, as shown in Figure 3.5:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: When the frequency of the driving oscillation \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) (blue), we see the amplitude grow to a plateau at which point the energy put into the system is equal to the energy losses from the system."

    "section": "3.5 Energy in driven oscillators",
    "text": "3.5 Energy in driven oscillators\nIn a driven oscillator, energy is continually added to the system. When it reaches its steady state, the rate of loss of energy in each cycle due to damping of the system is equal to the work done by the driving force.\nWe can demonstrate this through integration; remember that (simplistically!) work done is “force \\(\\times\\) distance”, so under varying force (as we have here), we can integrate the force with respect to displacement \\(x\\) to find an expression for the work done.\nFor the sake of convenience, we will consider the “real” component of the equation for forced SHM shown in Equation 3.1 (the left-hand-side is entirely “real”, so the “imaginary” component reduces to zero anyway):\n\\[\nm \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + b \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}+ kx = F_0 \\cos \\omega t\n\\tag{3.15}\\]\nWe also know that the steady state solution for the displacement \\(x\\) in SHM is as given in Equation 1.5. We can then find an expression for the velocity \\(v\\) by finding the first derivative of this expression (Equation 3.16):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx& =& A \\cos (\\omega t - \\delta)\\\\\nv = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} &=& -\\omega A \\sin (\\omega t - \\delta)\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{3.16}\\]\n\n3.5.1 Energy input for driven oscillators\nTo find the energy which is put into the system over one cycle, we therefore need to find the integral of the force acting over one cycle of the oscillation, from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = T\\) (remember that \\(T\\) is the period of the oscillation). We do this integration by substituting our variable \\(\\mathrm{d}x\\) for \\(v\\mathrm{d}t\\) (as defined in Equation 3.16):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nE_\\mathrm{in} = \\displaystyle{\\int_0^T} F \\cdot \\mathrm{d}x &\\equiv& \\displaystyle{\\int_0^T} F \\cdot v \\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&=& \\displaystyle{\\int_0^T} F_0 \\cos \\omega t \\cdot \\left[ -\\omega A \\sin (\\omega t + \\delta)\\right] \\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&=& -\\omega A F_0 \\displaystyle{\\int_0^T} \\cos \\omega t \\cdot \\sin (\\omega t + \\delta) \\\\\n&=& -\\omega A F_0 \\displaystyle{\\int_0^T} \\cos \\omega t \\cdot \\left[ \\sin \\omega t \\cos \\delta + \\cos \\omega t \\sin \\delta  \\right] \\\\\n&=& -\\omega A F_0 \\displaystyle{\\int_0^T} \\left[ \\cos \\omega t \\sin \\omega t \\cos \\delta + \\cos \\omega t \\cos \\omega t \\sin \\delta \\right] \\\\\n&=& -\\omega A F_0 \\displaystyle{\\int_0^T} \\left[ \\tfrac{1}{2} \\sin 2\\omega t \\cos \\delta + \\left( \\tfrac{1}{2}\\cos 2\\omega t + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\right) \\sin \\delta \\right] \\\\\n&=& -\\omega A F_0 \\left[ -\\tfrac{1}{4\\omega} \\cos 2\\omega t \\cos \\delta  + \\left( \\tfrac{1}{4\\omega}\\sin 2\\omega t + \\tfrac{t}{2} \\right)\\sin \\delta \\right]_0^T\\\\\n&=& -\\omega A F_0 \\left( \\left[ -\\tfrac{1}{4\\omega} \\cos 2\\omega T \\cos \\delta  + \\left( \\tfrac{1}{4\\omega}\\sin 2\\omega T + \\tfrac{T}{2} \\right)\\sin \\delta \\right] - \\left[ -\\tfrac{1}{4\\omega} \\cos 0 \\cos \\delta  + \\left( \\tfrac{1}{4\\omega}\\sin 0 + \\tfrac{0}{2} \\right)\\sin \\delta \\right] \\right)  \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nEvaluation of this integral gives us the end result shown in Equation 3.17:\n\\[\nE_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega A F_0 T \\sin \\delta\n\\tag{3.17}\\]\nIf we recall that \\(\\delta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) at resonance, substitution of this value into Equation 3.17 tells us that the maximum energy is transferred to the oscillator when driven at a resonant frequency - in line with our expectations.\nIf we now use the definition of \\(\\delta\\) in Equation 3.5, we can use trigonometry and the expression for \\(A\\) in Equation 3.4 to give the expression \\(\\sin \\delta = \\frac{Ab\\omega}{F_0}\\); we can also use the fact that the period of oscillation \\(T\\) and the angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) are related by Equation 1.12 (\\(T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\)), and simplify the expression for the energy input for the forced oscillator as shown in Equation 3.18:\n\\[\nE_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\pi b \\omega A^2\n\\tag{3.18}\\]\n\n\n3.5.2 Energy lost in driving oscillators\nTo now determine the amount of energy, we follow a similar process as followed in Section 3.5.1. This time however we need to determine the work done by the oscillator on the damping force during one cycle. This integral is set up as follows:\n\\[\nE_{\\mathrm{lost}} = \\int_0^T F v \\mathrm{d}t\n\\]\n…but this time the force is the damping force, \\(F_{\\mathrm{damp}} = bv\\).\n\\[\nE_{\\mathrm{lost}} = \\int_0^T b v^2 \\mathrm{d}t\n\\]\nAs before, we have the result that \\(v = -\\omega A \\sin(\\omega t - \\delta)\\) (Equation 3.16), and following through the integration in a similar manner as in the previous section we are led to the result in Equation 3.19 for a driven damped oscillator at steady state.\n\\[\nE_{\\mathrm{lost}}  = \\pi b \\omega A^2= E_{\\mathrm{in}}\n\\tag{3.19}\\]\nThis result should not be a surprise; at a steady state, we expect the energy lost to be equivalent to the energy put into the system, however it is nice that this is vindicated through the mathematics!\nA similar result may be obtained for electrical systems in resonance.\nNote: When \\(b = 0\\) the above result appears to fail (no energy is lost, but none is put in??); in fact, in an undamped system there can be no steady state (as no energy is lost!), so the amplitude of vibration \\(A \\rightarrow \\infty\\), so this result does not apply."

    "text": "3.6 Impedance\nAs you learn about fields, you will examine electrical circuits and see that circuits containing capacitors and inductors are analogous to mechanical oscillators, with the electrical charge oscillating within the circuit. These properties of circuits have many important applications and you will find that much of the analysis we have done here can be applied to those electrical systems.\nIn the context of an electrical circuit it is useful to define the term impedance a measure of the opposition to the flow of current, and is defined as the ratio of the voltage to current (\\(\\frac{V}{I}\\)) for a particular circuit component. For a resistor this is simply the resistance, however capacitors and inductors also possess impedance.\nIt turns out to be helpful to write this impedance as a complex number with components in both the real and imaginary plane. This works well with the complex representation of oscillations and naturally takes care of any differences in phase of the current and voltage in different components.\nBringing the analogy back to mechanical oscillations, a mechanical system can also be considered to have an impedance. We define the mechanical impedance as the force required to produce unit velocity, i.e. \\(Z_m = \\frac{F}{v}\\), or \\(F = vZ_m\\). This is the mechanical equivalent of Ohm’s law; force corresponding to the voltage, and velocity corresponding to current.\nThis idea of mechanical impedance will be useful in discussion of wave propagation."

    "text": "4.2 Coupling the oscillators\nSo far, this is unremarkable. However, when we connect the two masses with a third spring, we can start to consider the coupled interactions. We illustrate this in Figure 4.3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: The two oscillating masses from our earlier example are now connected by a third spring, of spring constant \\(k_{AB}\\). We can asssume that all other parameters retain their previous definitions.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the equations of motion here, we need to consider the forces on each oscillating mass. Put simply; there are two forces acting on each mass to control their oscillations; the force from its original spring (\\(F_A\\) or \\(F_B\\)), and the new force from the coupling spring, \\(F_{AB}\\).\nFrom Figure 4.3 we can see that the overall extension of the coupling spring, \\(\\delta\\) will be given by:\n\\[\n\\delta = x_B - x_A\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\nThe appearance of the negative sign in Equation 4.3 initially appears counter-intuitive, however consider the signs on each of the extensions in reference to the arbitrary ‘positive’ direction we defined earlier:\n\nIf \\(x_B = x_A\\), there will be no extension; so no force will be applied from the coupling spring\nIn the diagram above, \\(x_A\\) is negative; this gives a double-negative in Equation 4.3, with a positive value of \\(\\delta\\) (a stretched spring)\nHowever, if \\(x_A\\) is sufficiently positive, it will result in a negative value of \\(\\delta\\), indicating a compressed spring.\n\nYou may find it helpful to draw sketches of each of these situations to reason it through!\nOk, let’s first consider the total force acting on mass \\(A\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nF_{\\mathrm{Total, }A} &=& F_A + F_{AB} \\\\\n&=& -k_A x_A + k_{AB}(\\delta) \\\\\n&=& -k_A x_A + k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) \\\\\n&=& m_A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\nWe can reason the direction of the force \\(F_AB\\) from a sketch; if the coupling spring is stretched (positive \\(\\delta\\)), the force will be in the positive direction. If the coupling spring is compressed (negative \\(\\delta\\)) the force will be in the negative direction.\nThis situation changes slightly for mass \\(B\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nF_{\\mathrm{Total, }B} &=& F_B - F_{AB} \\\\\n&=& -k_B x_B - k_{AB}(\\delta) \\\\\n&=& -k_B x_B - k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) \\\\\n&=& m_B \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\nIn this case, a stretched coupling spring (positive \\(\\delta\\)) will cause a force in the negative direction and vice versa.\nWe have therefore generated two equations of motion to describe the coupled oscillator:\n\\[\n-k_A x_A + k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) = m_A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\nand\n\\[\n-k_B x_B - k_{AB}(x_B - x_A) = m_B \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\n\\tag{4.7}\\]"

    "section": "4.6 Normal coordinates",
    "text": "4.6 Normal coordinates\nBut where are the practicalities of all this? So far, we have done a lot of mathematical manipulation to arrive at two coupled equations (Equation 4.19) which, while they ostensibly describe the position of two coupled oscillating masses, still remain frustratingly abstract! It is helpful to return to the ‘simple’ expressions in Equation 4.13 and Equation 4.14:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y_1}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = -k y_1 \\\\\nm\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y_2}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} = -(k+ 2k_{AB}) y_2 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.20}\\]\nThese underlying ‘natural variables’, \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\), are much simpler to consider and work with, and we therefore call these variables “normal coordinates”, as it is simpler to work with these directly, and then return to displacement/velocity/acceleration coordinates of the system. It also helps us to visualise what is happening within the system. To do this, we will take the two extreme situations - when \\(x_A = x_B\\), and when \\(x_A = -x_B\\).\nIt is helpful to have the following on hand:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\ny_1 &=& x_A + x_B \\\\\ny_2 &=& x_A - x_B\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n4.6.1 When \\(x_A = x_B\\)\nIn this situation, \\(y_1 = 2x\\), and \\(y_2 = 0\\). From equation Equation 4.18, the \\(y_2\\) term reduces to zero, and we have the displacements for each oscillator as Equation 4.21:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_1 &= & \\frac{1}{2} B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\phi_1) \\\\\nx_2 &=& \\frac{1}{2} B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\phi_1) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.21}\\]\nWe can see from the mathematics that the displacement of each mass from its equilibrium point is identical, however it is often helpful to visualise this motion. In this case, the mid-point between the masses may be considered to be moving in concert with the two masses (Figure 4.4):\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: When the initial displacement of each oscillator is identical, the coupling spring is neither stretched nor compressed, so has no effect on the oscillation period of each oscillator. The oscillation of each mass is identical and perfectly in phase.\n\n\n\n\nFundamentally, from Equation 4.3 we know that if \\(x_A = x_B\\), then the extension of the coupling spring is zero. Therefore each mass may be considered to be oscillating exactly in phase and only under the influence of its spring, \\(k\\). We would expect therefore the oscillation frequency to match that of the uncoupled oscillators introduced in Section 4.1.\n\n\n4.6.2 When \\(x_A = - x_B\\)\nThis is the exact opposite situation to that discussed above. In this situation, \\(y_1 = 0\\), and \\(y_2 = 2x\\). As it is the \\(y_0\\) term which is now reduced to zero in Equation 4.18, this expression reduces to Equation 4.22:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_1 &= & \\frac{1}{2} B_2 \\cos(\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2) \\\\\nx_2 &=& - \\frac{1}{2} B_2 \\cos(\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.22}\\]\nNow we have a symmetry; at any stage of motion, mass \\(A\\) will be displaced by the same amount as mass \\(B\\) in the opposite direction. The consequence of this now is that the mid-point between the masses now does not move as the masses oscillate, and can be considered a node (Figure 4.5).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: When the initial displacement of each oscillator is identical but opposite, the coupling spring is either fully stretched or fully compressed. It may now be considered to be fully active in the oscillation. This time, the oscillation of each mass, while identical, is perfectly out of phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.3 Application of normal coordinates\nThese two situations describe the two vibrational “modes” of this coupled system, termed normal modes; any oscillation of this system is completely described by the combination of contributions from each mode (\\(y_1\\) describing the uncoupled contribution, \\(y_2\\) describing the fully coupled contribution)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of normal coordinates\n\n\n\n\nNormal coordinates arise from equations of motion expressed in the form of linear differential equations, each with only a single dependent variable (\\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) in our examples).\nA normal mode of vibration is a vibration of the system which involves only one dependent variable (either \\(y_1\\) or \\(y_2\\) in our examples)\nEach normal mode of vibration has its own characteristic frequency, its normal frequency\nThe overall vibration of a system may be described as a series of contributions from each normal mode; each normal mode is independent of other normal modes, and energy is never exchanged between normal modes."

    "section": "4.7 Particular solutions",
    "text": "4.7 Particular solutions\nWe covered two particular solutions above, concerning the extreme cases of the normal coordinates, however there are other interesting cases. One particular case occurs when a vibration is initiated with one mass in its equilibrium position and only the other mass is disturbed. The coupling spring of course transfers energy from the moving mass to the stationary one, however due to the similarity in mass, we start to observe resonance effects (Figure 4.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on energy transfer\n\n\n\nWhen considering the individual masses in a coupled system, we of course have transfer of energy occurring between the two masses. However it is important to recognise that while energy is transferred between coupled oscillators, energy is not transferred between the normal vibrational modes describing that oscillation of the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: If one mass is held stationary at its equilibrium position while the other is displaced as a starting condition, then we see that energy is transferred from one oscillator to the other and back again. In this example, \\(k = 10 k_{AB}\\)\n\n\n\n\nThis resonant energy transfer between each oscillator is particularly apparent when the coupling spring has a considerably lower spring constant than the springs connecting the oscillators to the rigid walls (the local springs); in Figure 4.6 the coupling spring has a constant which is one-tenth that of the local springs.\nWe can solve this example algebraically. Let’s re-exmine to the general solution for the coupled oscillator (Equation 4.23)\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_1 &= & \\frac{1}{2} B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\phi_1) + \\frac{1}{2}B_2 \\cos (\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2)\\\\\nx_2 &=& \\frac{1}{2} B_1 \\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\phi_1) - \\frac{1}{2}B_2 \\cos (\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.23}\\]\nWe said that at the start, our initial conditions would be that one oscillator is displaced to amplitude \\(A\\) while the other is held at its equilibrium. Therefore our starting conditions become:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl rcl}\nx_1 (0) &=& A &\n\\dot{x}_1 (0) &=& 0 \\\\\nx_2 (0) &=& 0 &\n\\dot{x}_2 (0) &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n\\] The result of this is that our phase constant \\(\\phi\\) evaluates to zero, while the amplitude component \\(B_1 = B_2 = A\\). We can apply these to Equation 4.23 to obtain a particular solution:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_1 &= & \\frac{1}{2} A \\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\frac{1}{2}A \\cos (\\omega_2 t)\\\\\nx_2 &=& \\frac{1}{2} A \\cos(\\omega_1 t) - \\frac{1}{2}A \\cos (\\omega_2 t )\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.24}\\]\nThis can then be rewritten using the appropriate trigonometric identity as:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx_1 &= & A \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\omega_2 -\\omega_1}{2} t \\right)\n\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\omega_2 +\\omega_1}{2} t \\right)\\\\\nx_2 &=& A \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\omega_2 -\\omega_1}{2} t \\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\omega_2 +\\omega_1}{2} t \\right)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.25}\\]\nWe said that this resonance transfer was particularly great when there is an appreciable difference between the spring constants of the coupling spring and the local springs; let’s therefore consider what is going on.\nWhen the spring constant of the coupling spring \\(k_AB\\) is much greater than \\(k\\), this will affect the frequencies \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\). From Equation 4.16, when \\(k_AB &lt;&lt; k\\), then the values of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) will be similar in magnitude, with \\(\\omega_2\\) only slightly larger. This means that the value of \\(\\omega_2 - \\omega_1\\) will be very small, while \\(\\omega_2 + \\omega_1\\) will be considerably larger.\nWe therefore have two cosine terms governing \\(x_1\\):\n\n\\(\\cos \\left( \\frac{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1}{2} t \\right)\\) will oscillate much slower than \\(\\cos \\left( \\frac{\\omega_2 + \\omega_1}{2} t \\right)\\)\nWe view this as an oscillator of frequency \\(\\left( \\frac{\\omega_2 + \\omega_1}{2} \\right)\\), whose amplitude varies slowly with frequency \\(\\left( \\frac{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1}{2} \\right)\\)\n\nA very similar situation exists for for \\(x_2\\), however the terms are governed by sine functions - which are \\(\\pi/2\\) out of phase with the oscillations of the first.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Comparing the changes of position of coupled oscillators A and B as a function of time; note that the energy transfers back and forward between A and B such that each is contained within envelopes with a \\(\\pi / 2\\) phase difference, although it appears as though it is a \\(\\pi\\) phase offset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note about phases of beats\n\n\n\nThe second amplitude term described above can be called the envelope of the primary oscillation - in that it contains the amplitude of the primary oscillation within itself.\nAlthough the oscillations of the second coupled oscillator are \\(\\pi/2\\) out of phase with the oscillations of the first, practically we observe that one is a maximum while the other is a minimum; the nature of an envelope is to contain a primary function, and its amplitude maxima of the primary function occur twice per envelope cycle giving the appearance of amplitudes being perfectly out of phase."

    "section": "4.8 The general solution: a matrix approach",
    "text": "4.8 The general solution: a matrix approach\nWe have shown above how we can obtain a solution for a system of two coupled oscillators, together with methods for finding a general solution. However, what happens when we have three coupled oscillators? Or four? Or - given that in materials we are dealing with solid lattices of bonded molecules - an almost uncountable number of coupled oscillators? The approaches detailed above become extremely difficult with each additional oscillator. We therefore need a method which is scalable.\nIn Section 4.2 we set up the equations of motion for the coupled oscillator (Equation 4.6 and Equation 4.6); these are reproduced below in Equation 4.27:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nm_A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -k_A x_A + k_{AB}(x_B - x_A)\\\\\nm_B \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -k_B x_B - k_{AB}(x_B - x_A)\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.26}\\]\nLet’s rewrite these equations to group our \\(x_A\\) and \\(x_B\\) terms rather than the \\(k\\) terms:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nm_A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -(k_A + k_{AB}) x_A + k_{AB}x_B \\\\\nm_B \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -(k_B + k_{AB}) x_B + k_{AB}x_A\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.27}\\]\nFrom your understanding of differential equations, you should recognise these as linear differential equations; therefore you should know that we can apply the principles of linear algebra to solve the equations. We can therefore use matrices and eigenstates to determine our solutions.\nWe can add together the differential equations in Equation 4.27 and then write the result in matrix form as follows (Equation 4.28)\n\\[\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nm_A & 0 \\\\\n0 & m_B\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n=\n-\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n(k_A + k_{AB}) & -k_{AB} \\\\\n-k_{AB} & (k_B + k_{AB})\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nx_A \\\\\nx_B\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\tag{4.28}\\]\nFor simplicity, we will now define a ‘spring matrix’, \\(K\\), defining the springs constant, and a ‘mass matrix’, \\(M\\) (Equation 4.29)\n\\[\nK\n=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n(k_A + k_{AB}) & -k_{AB} \\\\\n-k_{AB} & (k_B + k_{AB})\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\quad ; \\quad\nM\n=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nm_A & 0 \\\\\n0 & m_B\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\tag{4.29}\\]\nThis allows us to tidily rewrite Equation 4.28 as Equation 4.30:\n\\[\nM \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -K \\bar{x}\n\\tag{4.30}\\]\n…where:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} =\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nx_A \\\\\nx_B\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\quad \\mathsf{ and } \\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t} =\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_B}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\]\nYou will recall from your mathematics lectures that you can solve such matrix equations by multiplying both sides of the equation by the inverse of a matrix; in this case we will multiply both sides of Equation 4.30 by the inverse \\(M^{-1}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nM^{-1} M \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &=& -M^{-1} K \\bar{x}\\\\\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} & =& -M^{-1} K \\bar{x}\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.31}\\]\n…where \\(M^{-1}\\) is:\n\\[\nM^{-1} =\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{1}{m_A} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{m_B}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\]\nIf we express \\(M^{-1}K\\) as \\(D\\), the dynamics equation, we can write this matrix equation as:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}  = -D \\bar{x}\n\\tag{4.32}\\]\nWe can immediately see the connection between the matrix equation shown in Equation 4.31 and the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator. Let’s now develop this.\n\n4.8.1 A trial solution\nLet’s now assume a simple case, with a single oscillation frequency. We will use a trial solution for all vibrational modes, in the form \\(A \\cos (\\omega t + \\phi)\\). Let’s define each solution of \\(x_n\\) in this manner:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx_{A, \\mathrm{trial}} = A_1 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) \\\\\nx_{B, \\mathrm{trial}} = A_2 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.33}\\]\nWe have been working with matrix forms; so let’s represent this in a matrix form:\n\\[\n\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{trial}} =\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nA_1 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) \\\\\nA_2 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n= \\bar{A} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) \\quad \\mathrm{where} \\quad\n\\bar{A} =\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nA_1\\\\\nA_2\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\tag{4.34}\\]\nThis matrix form is now using \\(\\bar{A}\\); the mode amplitude vector. We can now find the second derivative of this to be:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{trial}}}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -\\omega^2 \\bar{A}\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n\\tag{4.35}\\]\n…which, when we know from Equation 4.32 that the second derivative should give us \\(-D \\bar{A} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\\), we obtain the result:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\omega^2 \\bar{A}\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) &=& -D \\bar{A} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) \\\\\nD \\bar{A} &=& \\omega^2 \\bar{A}\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.36}\\]\nEquation 4.36 is the main result of this process; that being that the amplitude vector of a vibrational mode is an eigenvector of the dynamics matrix \\(D\\) with the eigenvalue being the square of the frequency of that mode.\n\n\n4.8.2 The general case\nWe have said Equation 4.36 as an eigenvalue equation; this is one of the most important tools in physics, and it is essential to understand how they work. In this case, we will apply this to determine the frequencies for a coupled oscillator and check with our results above.\nWe already seen the end result, that \\(D \\bar{A} = \\omega^2 \\bar{A}\\), having constructed this assuming a single oscillation frequency. But how does this scale, particularly as we said earlier that we expect two frequencies, one from each vibrational mode?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA refresher on eigenvalue equations\n\n\n\nFor an eigenvalue equation, an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) will have \\(n\\) eigenvalues (\\(\\lambda_i\\)) and \\(n\\) eigenvectors \\(\\bar{x}_i\\) such that:\n\\[\nA \\bar{x}_i = \\lambda_i \\bar{x}_i\n\\] To find our eigenvalues, we need to rearrange and solve for \\(\\lambda_i\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nA \\bar{x}_i - \\lambda_i \\bar{x}_i &=& 0 \\\\\nA \\bar{x}_i - \\lambda_i \\mathbf{I} \\bar{x}_i &=& 0 \\\\\n(A - \\lambda_i \\mathbf{I}) \\bar{x}_i &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n\\] Remember that we need to multiply \\(\\lambda_i\\) by the identity matrix \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) because we cannot perform addition/subtraction on matrices of different dimensions.\nWe can now solve the eigenvalue equation; either \\(\\bar{x}_i = 0\\) (a null result), or the determinant of the matrix \\(|A - \\lambda_i \\mathbf{I}| = 0\\). Evaluating this determinant will give the characteristic polynomial which, when solved for \\(\\lambda_i\\), will give the eigenvalues for the equation.\n\n\nWe start with our eigenvalue equation, and we can rearrange this to obtain an expression which will allow us to evaluate the eigenvalue (Equation 4.37).\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nD \\bar{A} &=& \\omega^2 \\bar{A}\\\\\nD \\bar{A} - \\omega^2 \\bar{A} &=& 0 \\\\\nD \\bar{A} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{I} \\bar{A} &=& 0 \\\\\n(D - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{I}) \\bar{A} &=& 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.37}\\]\nFrom this statement, either \\(\\bar{A}\\) is equal to zero, or the determinant of the matrix \\((D - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{I})\\) is equal to zero. Clearly we use this second result to determine the value of the eigenvalue, \\(\\omega^2\\).\nRemembering from Section 4.8 we defined \\(D\\) as the dynamics matrix derived from the inverse of the ‘mass matrix’ and the ‘spring matrix’ such that:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nD = M^{-1}K &= &\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{1}{m_A} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{m_B}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n(k_A + k_{AB}) & -k_{AB} \\\\\n-k_{AB} & (k_B + k_{AB})\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\\\\\n&=&\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{k_A + k_{AB}}{m_A} & -\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_A} \\\\\n-\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_B} & \\frac{k_A + k_{AB}}{m_B}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.38}\\]\nNow, we set up the matrix form of our eigenvalue equation from Equation 4.37; remembering that we are looking for the eigenvalues which result in a determinant of zero. Let’s work it through!\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n(D - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{I}) \\bar{A} &=& 0 \\\\\n\\mathrm{det}\\left[ \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{k_A + k_{AB}}{m_A} & -\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_A} \\\\\n-\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_B} & \\frac{k_A + k_{AB}}{m_B}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n- \\omega^2\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1&0\\\\\n0&1\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right) \\right] &=& 0 \\\\\n\\mathrm{det}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\left(\\frac{ k_A + k_{AB}}{m_A} \\right)-\\omega^2 & -\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_A} \\\\\n-\\frac{k_{AB}}{m_B} & \\left(\\frac{k_A + k_{AB}}{m_B}\\right)-\\omega^2\n\\end{array}\n\\right] &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.39}\\]\nWe will simplify the arrangement somewhat by considering the coupled oscillator we have been examining above; where the local springs \\(k_A\\) and \\(k_B\\) have the same spring constant, \\(k\\), and the oscillators \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same mass, \\(m\\). Our determinant then becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\mathrm{det}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\left(\\frac{ k + k_{AB}}{m} \\right)-\\omega^2 & -\\frac{k_{AB}}{m} \\\\\n-\\frac{k_{AB}}{m} & \\left(\\frac{k + k_{AB}}{m}\\right)-\\omega^2\n\\end{array}\n\\right] &=& 0 \\\\\n\\left[\\left(\\frac{ k + k_{AB}}{m} \\right) - \\omega^2 \\right]^2 - \\frac{k_{AB}^2}{m^2} &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.40}\\]\nThis relation is now a quadratic in \\(\\omega^2\\); as such, it will have two solutions - each corresponding to a different value of \\(\\omega\\) - this is what we are expecting - to find \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) above. So we solve for \\(\\omega^2\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\left[\\left(\\frac{ k + k_{AB}}{m} \\right) - \\omega^2 \\right]^2 - \\frac{k_{AB}^2}{m^2} &=& 0 \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{ k + k_{AB}}{m} \\right) - \\omega^2 &=& \\pm \\frac{k_{AB}}{m} \\\\\nk + k_{AB} - m\\omega^2 &=& \\pm k_{AB} \\\\\nm\\omega^2 &=& \\mp k_{AB} + (k+k_{AB}) \\\\\n\\\\\n\\omega^2 = \\dfrac{k}{m} &\\mathsf{or}& \\omega^2 = \\dfrac{2k_{AB} + k}{m}\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{4.41}\\]\nAs we can see in Equation 4.41 we gain a result for \\(\\omega^2\\) which gives us the two solutions for \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) which we uncovered in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nRemember the frequencies that we have found here correspond to the frequencies of the normal modes of vibration of the system (Section 4.6.3). They are used to describe the motion of individual oscillating masses, but both frequencies apply to each oscillating mass - not one frequency for each mass!"

    "section": "4.9 Why use matrices?",
    "text": "4.9 Why use matrices?\nWe have shown a few routes to look at coupled oscillators, each of which we have demonstrated to lead to the same outcome. The obvious question is why use so many approaches?\nWhen we looked at the separate differential equations, it was a problem which is possible to solve here for two coupled oscillators, however it is not a method which is particularly scalable, for either different masses, different spring constants, or even a larger number of coupling oscillators.\nThe matrix approach however is scalable - it is simple in its form allowing us to see the nature of the oscillation and that it is - at its heart - still harmonic, however this simple form will scale readily for larger systems. We could look at a system of five linearly coupled oscillators, and we would expect a \\(5\\times 5\\) spring (and hence dynamics) matrix, the determinant of which would be a fifth order polynomial with five solutions for the oscillation frequency, each corresponding to the frequency of a normal mode of vibration for the system.\nSolving a determinant for a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix by hand is doable, for a \\(4\\times 4\\) matrix is troublesome, and a \\(5 \\times 5\\) matrix is downright inconvenient. However, computers are excellent at resolving determinants of matrices - making solving such problems possible - provided we know what instructions to give the computer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications of matrix methods\n\n\n\nMatrices are universal in physics, and it is hard to understate the importance of solving eigenvalue equations. Linear algebra is central to quantum physics, and greatly simplifies the process of solving complex interlinked systems. The methods shown above are simply one application of the techniques."

We consider the string to be fixed at both ends and the masses to be separated by a fixed horizontal distance \\(a\\) (Figure 6.1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: A system of equally spaced masses on a tensioned string. The masses are equally spaced, and undergo oscillations perpendicular to the axis of the string.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to develop the equations of motion here, we need to take a number of steps:\n\nKnowing the masses only oscillate vertically, we need to find the vertical component of the tension for each mass\nWe use this to determine the equation of motion for a given mass on the string\nFinally, we look at what happens to each mass along a string.\n\nLet’s take each step in turn\n\n6.1.1 Consolidating the forces\nLet’s consider the mass in the middle of Figure 6.1. We will label this arbitrary \\(n\\)th mass \\(n\\). We consider the forces on it along the string towards the \\((n-1)\\)th and \\((n+1)\\)th mass. To do this, we identify a few lengths and the angles \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) (Figure 6.2):\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Consolidating the forces on the middle mass, mass \\(n\\). We consider everythign relative to the \\(y\\) position of this oscillator and the effect of the masses to either side. The angles \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) indicate the angles the forces make to the horizontal.\n\n\n\n\nThe vertical component of the tension to the left will be given by \\(T\\sin \\theta_1\\), while the vertical component of the tension to the right will be given by \\(T \\sin \\theta_2\\).\nThrough the small-angle approximation, we can say:\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta_1 = \\frac{(y_{n-1} - y_n)}{a} \\approx \\sin \\theta_1\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta_2 = \\frac{(y_{n+1} - y_n)}{a} \\approx \\sin \\theta_2\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nThe total force acting on the mass therefore becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nF_{\\mathsf{total}} &=& T(\\sin \\theta_1 + \\sin \\theta_2) \\\\\n&=& T \\left(\\frac{(y_{n-1} - y_n)}{a} + \\frac{(y_{n+1} - y_n)}{a} \\right) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\n\n\n6.1.2 The equations of motion\nNow that we have identified the vertical force acting on our mass (Equation 6.3) we can now write our equation of motion.

In the example shown in Figure 6.2, \\(y_n &lt; y_{n-1}\\) and \\(y_n &lt; y_{n+1}\\), so we expect a positive value, so a positive force. If the situation is reversed, and \\(y_n &gt; y_{n-1}\\) and \\(y_n &gt; y_{n+1}\\), we would expect a negative value to arise, giving a negative value for the force.\n(While the sinusoidal functions are periodic, we are only concerned for values of \\(\\theta\\) in the range \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} &lt; \\theta &lt; \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote: remember that the \\(a\\) in Equation 6.23 is the separation between the masses on the tensioned string, not the acceleration!\n\n\nLet’s now use the approach used previously; insert a trial function into the equation of motion.

    "section": "6.2 The overview",
    "text": "6.2 The overview\nIn considering the case for each of \\(n\\) oscillating masses connected by a tensioned string, it is all very much looking like a coupled oscillator system, akin to that introduced in Section 4.8. We would therefore expect to have a set of \\(n\\) coupled equations, which in turn will give \\(n\\) different values of \\(\\omega^2\\). We can apply the matrix methods we introduced in Section 4.8, however let’s just look at the first two cases (one mass and two masses).\n\n6.2.1 A single mass on a tensioned string (\\(n = 1\\))\nThis is a fairly straightforward analysis. Adapting Equation 6.7, \\(A_{n-1}\\) and \\(A_{n+1}\\) reduce to zero as these represent the fixed ends of the string. Our fundamental equation therefore becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n-A_{0} + \\left(2-\\frac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)A_1 - A_{2} &=& 0 \\\\\n\\left(2-\\frac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)A_1 &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n\\] …with the result that\n\\[\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{2T}{ma}\n\\tag{6.8}\\]\nWe therefore have a single vibrational frequency, \\(\\omega\\) when we have a single mass oscillating on a tensioned string. This is not a great surprise, and is easily visualised.\n\n\n6.2.2 Two masses on a tensioned string, \\(n = 2\\):\nIf we have two masses on the string, we now need to consider the respective equations for the first (\\(n = 1\\)) and the second (\\(n = 2\\)) masses.\n\nFor \\(n = 1\\):\n\n\\(A_0 = 0\\)\n\nFor \\(n = 2\\):\n\n\\(A_{3} = 0\\)\n\n\nEquation 6.7 then becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n-A_{0} + \\left(2-\\frac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)A_1 - A_{2} &=& 0 \\\\\n-A_{1} + \\left(2-\\frac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)A_2 - A_{3} &=& 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nwhich, when we apply the boundary conditions for \\(A_0\\) and \\(A_3\\), becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\left(2-\\frac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)A_1 - A_{2} = 0 \\\\\n-A_{1} + \\left(2-\\frac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)A_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{6.9}\\]\nThis is simply a pair of simultaneous equations in \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\); substituting through to eliminate \\(A_2\\), we arrive at the result:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nA_1 \\left[\\left(2-\\dfrac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)^2 - 1 \\right] &=& 0 \\\\\n\\left(2-\\dfrac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)^2 - 1 &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThis now factorises:\n\\[\n\\left(2-\\dfrac{ma\\omega^2}{T} +1 \\right) \\left(2-\\dfrac{ma\\omega^2}{T} - 1 \\right) = 0\n\\] This shows that we end up with two possible solutions for \\(\\omega^2\\):\n\\[\n\\omega_1^2 = \\frac{T}{ma} \\quad \\mathsf{and} \\quad \\omega_2^2 = \\frac{3T}{ma}\n\\tag{6.10}\\]\nThese are the frequencies corresponding to the normal modes of vibration on the string; note that while the values are different to the coupled oscillator model in Chapter 4, the principle is the same - where two oscillating masses give two characteristic frequencies, each corresponding to a specific normal mode.\n\n\n6.2.3 The general case, \\(n\\) masses on a tensioned string:\nLet’s return to our fundamental equation (Equation 6.7):\n\\[\n-A_{n-1} + \\left(2-\\frac{ma\\omega^2}{T}\\right)A_n - A_{n+1} = 0\n\\] From Equation 6.8 for a single mass on a string we note that \\(\\omega_1^2 = \\frac{2T}{ma}\\); therefore the term \\(\\frac{T}{ma}\\) is intrinsically linked to a frequency. Let’s therefore define this as a fundamental frequency, \\(\\omega_0\\). We now use this reformulate our fundamental equation to isolate the \\(A\\) terms\n\\[\n\\frac{A_{n-1} + A_{n+1}}{A_n} = 2-\\frac{ma \\omega^2}{T} = \\frac{2\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2}{\\omega_0^2}\n\\tag{6.11}\\]\nIn Equation 6.11, the frequency \\(\\omega\\) represents any normal mode frequency; therefore for any fixed value of this the right-hand side of the equation is a constant regardless of which oscillating mass we are considering. So; can we solve the equation to find a value for the amplitude of the oscillation of the \\(n\\)th mass, \\(A_n\\)?\nFrom our coupled oscillator case in Chapter 4, we saw that for two oscillating masses in a coupled system, the amplitude varied sinusoidally (Equation 4.25, graphed in Figure 4.7). Let’s therefore assume that there is a general solution for the amplitude of the \\(j\\)th mass, \\(A_j\\).\n\n\n\n\\[\nA_j = B \\sin (j\\phi)\n\\tag{6.12}\\]\nIn this, \\(B\\) is a constant and \\(\\phi\\) is some constant value for a value of \\(\\omega_j\\). Let’s now place this into Equation 6.11:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\dfrac{A_{j-1} + A_{j+1}}{A_j} &=& \\dfrac{B \\left[\\sin ([j-1]\\phi) + \\sin ([j+1]\\phi) \\right]}{B \\sin (j\\phi)} \\\\\n&=& \\dfrac{\\sin(j\\phi)\\cos\\phi + \\sin\\phi\\cos(j\\phi) + \\sin(j\\phi)\\cos\\phi - \\sin\\phi\\cos(j\\phi)}{\\sin(j\\phi)} \\\\\n&=& 2\\cos\\phi\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{6.13}\\]\nWhat does this result mean? It shows us that the ratio of the amplitudes has a constant value, independent of the number of masses oscillating on the string. Note that the value of \\(\\phi\\) is dependent on which oscillating element we are considering; but to subscript \\(\\phi_j\\) onto everything would make it even more untidy!\nNow, if we can identify values for \\(\\phi\\), this will allow us to determine the allowed expressions for \\(\\omega\\), the frequencies of the normal modes in the system.\n\n\n6.2.4 Finding the amplitude of the \\(j\\)th element\nIn Equation 6.13 we have presented the general solution for the amplitude ratios of the \\(j\\)th element of an oscillating system:\n\\[\n\\frac{A_{j-1} + A_{j+1}}{A_j} = 2 \\cos \\phi_j\n\\tag{6.14}\\]\nTo find an expression for \\(\\phi_j\\), we can use our boundary conditions, namely that \\(A_0 = A_{n+1} = 0\\), and use this with the trial function \\(A_j = B \\sin (j\\phi)\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nA_0 = B \\sin 0\\phi = 0 \\\\\nA_{n+1} = B \\sin (n+1)\\phi = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{6.15}\\]\nThe first case is not particularly useful; let’s instead look at the second case. The boundary condition of the sine function being equal to zero gives us the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nB \\sin(n+1)\\phi &=& 0 \\\\\n\\sin (n+1)\\phi &=& 0\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{6.16}\\]\nFor this to be true, then: \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n(n+1)\\phi_m &=& 0, \\pi, 2\\pi, \\dots, r\\pi\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{6.17}\\]\n…where \\(r\\) is simply an arbitrary integer. This then gives us an expression for the \\(r\\)th value of \\(\\phi_r\\) in an \\(n\\)-oscillator system. This gives our values of \\(\\phi_r\\) as:\n\\[\n\\phi_r = \\frac{r\\pi}{n+1}\n\\tag{6.18}\\]\nPutting this back into the trial function we proposed (\\(A_j = B \\sin (j\\phi)\\)), we find that the amplitude of the \\(j\\)th mass at the fixed normal mode frequency \\(\\omega_r\\) to be:\n\\[\nA_j = B \\sin \\frac{jr\\pi}{n+1}\n\\tag{6.19}\\]\n\n\n6.2.5 Identifying the allowed frequencies\nWe can now use the expression for \\(\\phi_r\\) presented in Equation 6.18 and place this into Equation 6.13 and Equation 6.11\n\\[\n\\frac{A_{j-1} + A_{j+1}}{A_j} = \\frac{2\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_r^2}{\\omega_0^2} = 2\\cos\\phi_r = 2 \\cos \\frac{r\\pi}{n+1}\n\\]\nWe can then solve this for the frequency of the \\(r\\)th vibrational mode (\\(\\omega_r\\)) within the system:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\dfrac{2\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_r^2}{\\omega_0^2} &=& 2 \\cos \\dfrac{r\\pi}{n+1} \\\\\n2- \\dfrac{ \\omega_r^2}{\\omega_0^2} &=& 2 \\cos \\dfrac{r\\pi}{n+1}\\\\\n\\omega_r^2 &=& 2\\omega_0^2 \\left[ 1 - \\cos \\dfrac{r\\pi}{n+1} \\right]\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{6.20}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet soup!\n\n\n\nWe’ve used a lot of subscripts, so it is worth taking a bit of time to remind ourselves what we have used.\n\n\\(n\\) - We have \\(n\\) oscillators on our tensioned string, which will give \\(n\\) normal vibrational modes of the system.\n\\(j\\) - This is the label for the \\(j\\)th oscillator in our \\(n\\)-oscillator system. e.g. In a system of ten oscillators (\\(n = 10\\)), we may be looking at the fourth oscillating mass (\\(j = 4\\)).\n\\(r\\) - This is the label for the normal mode frequency of interest. So in a ten oscillator system (\\(n=10\\)), there are ten normal modes. Within this, we may be interested in the frequency of the sixth mode (\\(\\omega_r, r = 6\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Tying it all together - the takeaway points\nWe’ve done a lot of derivation here, but what are the take-away points?\n\n6.2.6.1 There is a maximum frequency of oscillation\nLooking at Equation 6.20, there is a maximum frequency of oscillation available. The cosine function can only vary between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\); when the cosine function is equal to \\(-1\\), then: \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\omega_{r,\\mathsf{max}}^2 &=& 2\\omega_0^2 [1 - (-1)] = 4\\omega_0^2 \\\\\n\\\\\n\\omega_{r,\\mathsf{max}} &=& 2\\omega_0\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{6.21}\\]\nThis frequency is called a cutoff frequency and is a feature of many lattice vibrations.\n\n\n6.2.6.2 The frequencies of normal modes of oscillation\nFrom Equation 6.20 and the value of \\(\\omega_0 = \\frac{T}{ma}\\), we can identify the frequency of any normal mode of oscillation within the system:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\omega_r^2 &=& 2\\omega_0^2 \\left[ 1 - \\cos \\dfrac{r\\pi}{n+1} \\right] \\\\\n&=& \\dfrac{2T}{ma} \\left[ 1 - \\cos \\dfrac{r\\pi}{n+1} \\right]\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{6.22}\\]\nTherefore, if we know the tension \\(T\\) in the string, the mass \\(m\\) of the oscillating masses (and that they are all the same mass), the number \\(n\\) of masses and the separation between the masses \\(a\\), we can identify the frequency of a given mode."

From Equation 6.23 we identified the equations of motion of the \\(j\\)th mass in an \\(n\\)-oscillator system:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y_j}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = \\frac{T}{ma}(y_{j-1} - 2y_j + y_{j+1})\n\\tag{6.23}\\]\nAlongside this, we also know that, for a system of \\(n\\) oscillating masses on a tensioned string, we will have \\(n\\) normal modes of vibration; within this set of modes, any given mode \\(r\\) will have a specific frequency \\(\\omega_r\\). This means that, in a given vibration mode, the \\(y\\)-displacement of each mass in the system will all have the same time dependence\nFinally, we know that the displacement \\(y_j\\) of the \\(j\\)th element must depend on the value of \\(j\\); if it did not, we would only see the simplest vibrations as all elements oscillate in concert, with \\(y_{j-1} = y_j = y_{j+1}\\). Given that the value of \\(j\\) is intrinsically connected to the \\(x\\) coordinate (where \\(x = (j - \\frac{1}{2})a\\)), we can say that the displacement must depend on \\(x\\).\nTherefore, we can say that there are two independent variables which are factored into the \\(y\\)-displacement; \\(t\\) and \\(x\\).\n\n\n6.3.2 Reducing the spacing between elements\nWe have said that \\(x\\) is related to the spacing between masses \\(a\\) and the position in the chain \\(j\\) - so what happens as we reduce the spacing? Let’s apply our principles of calculus, and reduce the spacing such that \\(a \\simeq \\partial x\\) and let \\(\\partial x \\rightarrow 0\\). This makes \\(x\\) a continuous variable, and therefore the vertical displacement of an element becomes dependent on \\(x\\) and \\(t\\); \\(y(x,t)\\).\nAs we now have two independent variables, we will now need to enter the world of partial derivatives.\n\n\n6.3.3 Modifying the equations…\nWe will assume that any coupled oscillation in this new continuous system will still be a sinusoidal function, but now dependent on \\(x\\) as well as \\(t\\). We propose it takes the form:\n\\[\ny(x,t) = \\sin (kx + \\omega t)\n\\tag{6.24}\\]\nFor now, we will say that the term \\(k\\) is there to keep the units of \\(kx\\) congruent with the units of \\(\\omega t\\); if the frequency \\(\\omega\\) is a “per second” (s\\(^{-1}\\)) unit to cancel the time unit of \\(t\\), then \\(k\\) must be a “per metre” unit (m\\(^{-1}\\)) to cancel the length unit of \\(x\\). It has deeper meaning which we will come to later.\nAs \\(x\\) is now a continuous variable, we can now return to Equation 6.23, and rewrite this as:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{T}{ma}(y_{j-1} - 2y_j + y_{j+1})\n\\tag{6.25}\\]\nWe now need to consider the meaning of \\(y_{j-1}\\), \\(y_j\\) and \\(y_{j+1}\\) in the context of a continuously variable \\(x\\). In Section 6.3.2 we said that the spacing \\(a\\) reduced to \\(\\partial x\\); we can therefore say:\n\n\\(y_j\\) becomes \\(y(x,t)\\)\n\\(y_{j-1}\\) becomes \\(y(x-\\partial x, t)\\)\n\\(y_{j+1}\\) becomes \\(y(x+\\partial x, t)\\)\n\nWe now use a Taylor series expansion on the function \\(y(x\\pm \\partial x , t)\\), and we obtain:\n\\[\ny(x\\pm \\partial x , t) = y(x) \\pm \\partial x \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} + \\frac{1}{2} (\\pm \\partial x)^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}\n\\]\nThis is when we say “so what?” Well, if we remember the initial form of Equation 6.23, it was actually derived from:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y_j}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = \\frac{T}{m}\\left( \\frac{y_{j+1} - y_j}{a} - \\frac{y_r - y_{j-1}}{a}\\right)\n\\]\nThis immediately gives us an equation we can use our Taylor series expansion on:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\dfrac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} &=& \\dfrac{T}{m}\\left( \\dfrac{y(x+\\partial x, t) - y(x,t)}{a} - \\dfrac{y(x,t) - y(x-\\partial x, t)}{a}\\right)\\\\\n&=& \\dfrac{T}{m}\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial x \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} + \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial x)^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}}{\\partial x} - \\dfrac{\\partial x \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial x)^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}}{\\partial x}\\right)\\\\\n&=& \\dfrac{T}{m} \\dfrac{(\\partial x)^2}{\\partial x} \\dfrac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2} \\\\\n&=& \\dfrac{T}{m} (\\partial x) \\dfrac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{6.26}\\]\nYou may find it helpful to ensure you can follow through the cancellation steps in this arrangement and verify your own understanding.\n\n\n6.3.4 The Wave Equation\nOur final step is to consider what the terms are in the final step in Equation 6.26, in particular the \\(\\partial x / m\\) term. If we invert it to obtain \\(m/\\partial x\\), we have a “mass per unit length”. This is often known as a ‘linear mass density’, and is usually assigned the symbol \\(\\rho\\). When we place this into Equation 6.26, we obtain:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{T}{\\rho}  \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}\n\\tag{6.27}\\]\nEquation 6.27 is the wave equation, and it is a tool we can use to verify the validity of a wave function - if, when differentiated appropriately, a function can fit this relation, then it is a valid wavefunction and can be used to describe a propagating wave.\nA useful observation in the wave equation is that the \\(T/\\rho\\) term has units m\\(^{2}\\) s\\(^{-2}\\); a speed squared. We may sometimes see this term replaced in the wave equation with a \\(v^2\\) term, corresponding with the speed of propagation of the wave.\nWe will revisit the wave equation again in the future."

    "text": "7.2 Deriving the wave equation\nTo better understand the wave equation, it is useful to know its derivation. To do this, we shall first consider a segment of string from a curved part of a wave pulse (Figure 7.6):\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: Here we consider a small portion of a string carrying a wave pulse; the tension in the string \\(F\\) is constant throughout, but resolving the forces via the angles \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) allows us to determine the equation of motion on this segment.\n\n\n\n\nThe length of this segment is \\(\\approx \\Delta x\\) (for small angles), and the mass of this segment of string \\(m = \\mu \\Delta x\\) (where \\(\\mu\\) is the mass per unit length). As we are considering a transverse wave, this segment of string will move vertically, and all forces acting on the segment arise from the tension force within the string. We can determine these forces by resolving the horizontal and vertical components of this force \\(F\\) using the parameters laid out in Figure 7.6.\nBy considering the net vertical force acting on this segment:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcll}\n\\sum F &=& F \\sin \\theta_2 - F \\sin \\theta_1 &\\\\\n&=& F \\left( \\tan \\theta_2 - \\tan \\theta_1 \\right) & \\textsf{for small angles}\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{7.4}\\]\nWe can also determine an expression for the slope, \\(S\\), of the segment of string at a given point:\n\\[\nS = \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\n\\tag{7.5}\\]\nThis means we can now express the overall force acting on the segment in terms of the slope of the segment at its start and end points (assuming small angles!) by combining Equation 7.4 and Equation 7.5 :\n\\[\n\\sum F = F(S_2 - S_1) = F \\Delta S\n\\tag{7.6}\\]\nThe quantity \\(F\\Delta S\\) in Equation 7.6 is the net force acting on the segment; so we can now apply Newton’s second law:\n\\[\nF\\Delta S = m a = \\mu \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2}\n\\tag{7.7}\\]\n…or, to rearrange:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\mu}{F} \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2}\n\\tag{7.8}\\]\nSince the slope \\(\\Delta S\\) of the segment is the ‘rate of change of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\)’ (Equation 7.5), we can redefine the term in Equation 7.7; in the limit, as \\(\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\Delta x} \\approx \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}\n\\tag{7.9}\\]\nFinally, by combining this result in Equation 7.9 with the result in Equation 7.8), we obtain the wave equation for a stretched string (Equation 7.10):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{F} \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2}\n\\tag{7.10}\\]\nAs we mentioned in Section 7.1, any function of the form \\(y = f(x \\pm vt)\\) will be a solution to the wave Equation 7.10. In the case of the string, the solution will solve the wave equation provided that \\(v^2 = \\frac{F}{\\mu}\\)."

    "text": "8.4 Energy carried by waves on a string\nSuppose we now have a string attached to an oscillating driver at one end. As the driver oscillates, it imparts energy to the string at \\(x=0\\) by:\n\nStretching the string to give it potential energy, and\nimparting transverse speed to the string to increase its kinetic energy.\n\nAs the waves move along the string, so the energy is transported along the string.\n\n8.4.1 Potential energy of string segment\nWe now consider the same string segment as we showed in Figure 7.6, but now we consider it stretched (Figure 8.2). We can picture this as the string is “relaxed” in its ‘horizontal’ orientation (length of segment is \\(\\Delta x\\)), but when a wave passes along it, the string elongates to accommodate the curve of the wave form. This means our segment now takes on a new length \\(\\Delta l\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: As the wave passes along a stretched string, we can consider it to be ‘stretched’; considering a string element of lencth \\(\\Delta x\\), it is stretched to new length \\(\\Delta l\\) as the wave passes by.\n\n\n\n\nThe work done (U) in stretching the segment \\(\\Delta x\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\Delta u = F(\\Delta l - \\Delta x)\n\\tag{8.12}\\]\n…where \\(F\\) is the tension in the string and the extension is given by \\((\\Delta l - \\Delta x)\\). We can apply Pythagoras to relate \\(\\Delta x\\) and \\(\\Delta l\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\Delta l^2 &=& \\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 \\\\\n&=& \\Delta x^2 \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 \\right]\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nTherefore we can isolate \\(\\Delta l\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta l = \\Delta x \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\nWe can approximate this expression by using the Taylor series expansion for \\(\\sqrt{1+n}\\), where \\(n = \\left( \\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2\\); assuming that the fraction is significantly less than one we can write this as an approximation and disregard terms past the first two terms:1\n\\[\n\\Delta l \\approx \\Delta x \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 + \\cdots \\right]\n\\]\nRearranging this expression to obtain the expression for the extension of the string \\(\\Delta l - \\Delta x\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta l - \\Delta x \\approx   + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\left( \\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 + \\cdots\n\\]\nThis now allows us to obtain an expression for the work done in stretching the spring solely in terms of the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) displacement (from Equation 8.12)\n\\[\n\\Delta U = \\frac{F\\Delta x}{2} \\left( \\dfrac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2\n\\]\nAs we have an expression for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) (Equation 8.2), we can differentiate this with respect to \\(x\\) to approximate \\(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\simeq \\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = kA \\cos (kx - \\omega t)\n\\]\nWe also know that \\(v^2 = \\frac{F}{\\mu}\\) (from the wave equation), and that \\(v = \\frac{\\omega}{k}\\) (Equation 8.8), therefore:\n\\[\n\\Delta U = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\mu \\omega^2}{k^2} \\right) \\Delta x \\left( kA \\cos (kx - \\omega t) \\right)^2\n\\]\nTidying up and cancelling, we obtain the expression for the potential energy stored in an element of string of length \\(\\Delta x\\) (Equation 8.13):\n\\[\n\\Delta U = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu \\omega^2 A^2 \\Delta x \\cos^2(kx-\\omega t)\n\\tag{8.13}\\]\n\n\n8.4.2 Kinetic energy of string segment\nWe will again consider the segment of string discussed in Section 8.4.1; an element \\(\\Delta x\\) of the string, of mass \\(\\Delta m\\) (Figure 8.3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Similar to the situation shown above, the same string segment will have a kinetic energy associated with its velocity \\(v_y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before, the segment is stretched to new length \\(\\Delta l\\), but the mass is still given by:\n\\[\n\\Delta m = \\mu \\Delta x\n\\]\n…where \\(\\mu\\) is the mass per unit length. We now use the transverse velocity of the segment (i.e. not the wave velocity) to determine the kinetic energy of the segment:\n\\[\n\\Delta KE = \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta m v_y^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu \\Delta x \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right)^2\n\\]\nAgain, we know the expression for the vertical displacement \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(t\\) (Equation 8.6), so we now differentiate with respect to \\(t\\):\n\n\\(y = A \\sin(kx - \\omega t)\\)\n\\(v_y = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\omega A \\cos(kx - \\omega t)\\)\n\nTherefore our expression for the kinetic energy becomes:\n\\[\n\\Delta KE =  \\frac{1}{2} \\mu \\omega^2  A^2 \\Delta x  \\cos^2(kx - \\omega t)\n\\tag{8.14}\\]\nA quick comparison of Equation 8.13 and Equation 8.14 shows that these expressions are identical; i.e. the KE stored in the string is the same as the PE stored in the spring.\n\n\n8.4.3 Total energy of wave on a string\nWe can therefore find the total energy of the string segment carrying a harmonic wave as the total of the kinetic and potential energies:\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\Delta KE + \\Delta U\n\\]\ni.e.:\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\mu \\omega^2  A^2 \\Delta x  \\cos^2(kx - \\omega t)\n\\tag{8.15}\\]\nNote that the energy of the segment varies with time with twice the frequency of the wave (since \\(\\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}(1+ \\cos 2\\theta)\\)).\nWe can also define the average energy at any point (Equation 8.16) using the time-average definition \\(\\left&lt; \\cos^2 \\theta \\right&gt; = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{av}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\omega^2 A^2 \\Delta x\n\\tag{8.16}\\]\n…and we can define the average energy density (per unit length) as:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{av}}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu \\omega^2 A^2\n\\]\nThere are several things to note from this derivation:\n\nKE is at a maximum when displacement is zero\nAt this point the string is most stretched, so PE is at a maximum also  \nPE and KE are in phase (unlike in a pendulum)\n\nThese points are illustrated in Figure 8.4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: The kinetic energy and potential energy of a displaced string element have maxima and minima at the same points in the oscillation; as the element passes through the origin (top plot), it is at its most stretched (PE maximum), and it is traveling at its fastest (KE maximum).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Transport of energy and power\nAs the wave propagates along the string, energy is transported by the moving wavefront at speed \\(v\\). The average energy passing a point on the string in time \\(\\Delta t\\) is the average energy in the segment of length \\(\\Delta x = v\\Delta t\\). This means we can rewrite Equation 8.16:\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{av}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\omega^2 A^2 v \\Delta t\n\\tag{8.17}\\]\nSince the power transmitted is a rate of change of energy, i.e. \\(\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta t}\\), we can obtain an expression for the average power transmitted:\n\\[\n\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{av}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} E_{\\mathrm{av}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{av}}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\omega^2 A^2 v\n\\tag{8.18}\\]\nFrom this result, we can see that both the average energy and average power transmitted are both proportional to \\(A^2\\); a similar observation as in SHM (Chapter 1)."

We can generalise the result by considering the impedances of the media on either side of the boundary.\nWe discussed the concept of impedance (both electrical and mechanical) in Section 3.6; however the salient points are:\n\n“Impedance” describes the property of a system which resists motion, either mechanical or motion of charge;\nAny material through which waves propagate presents impedance to those waves;\nIn general, impedance depends on inertia and elasticity;\nFor a string, we define impedance as:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{\\textrm{transverse force}}{\\textrm{transverse velocity}}\n\\]\ni.e. for a given force, a large \\(Z\\) implies a small velocity and vice versa; * Similar definitions can be written for longitudinal waves.\nWe now consider a string which is driven by an oscillating force (Figure 9.3)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: When a wave is driven by an oscillating force at its origin (\\(f\\)), the element of the string indicated by the dot experiences the tension within the string, \\(F\\), at angle \\(\\theta\\) from the direction of propagation.\n\n\n\n\nThe driving force on this string is given by the relationship:\n\\[\nf = -f_0 \\cos \\omega t = -f_0 \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}\n\\]\nThis driving force is negative because \\(f\\) points downwards at time \\(t = 0\\).\nAs this is a wave, the vertical displacement at any point is given by the relationship:\n\\[\ny = A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}(kx - \\omega t)}\n\\]\nWe now consider the tension in the string, \\(F\\), and resolve this in the transverse direction.

We can visualise this as a moving ‘dipper’ in a pool of water (Figure 10.1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: When a dipper (marked by the black dot) moves relative to the water, we see that the wavefronts ‘bunch’ in the direction of motion and diverge behind the motion of the dipper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: We can look at this in more detail by showing where the dipper was for each of the spreading wavefronts. Here the dipper is moving forward at speed \\(u_r\\), while the wavefronts spread out from their point of origin at speed \\(v\\).\n\n\n\n\nThis is a visual representation of a number of key statements:\n\nThe speed of waves \\(v\\) in the medium is independent of the movement of the source;\nThe source produces waves at a frequency \\(f_0\\);\nIn a given time frame, \\(\\Delta t\\), the source will emit \\(N_s\\) wavefronts, where: \\[\nN_s = f_0 \\Delta t\n\\]{#eq-}\n\nFrom these statements, we can calculate the observed wavelength, \\(\\lambda^\\prime\\), by considering the relative distance traveled by the wave in a given time-frame and the number of waves produced by the source in that time-frame (Equation 10.8):\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\frac{\\textsf{relative distance}}{\\textsf{no. of waves}} = \\frac{(v\\pm u_{s})\\Delta t}{f_{0}\\Delta t}\n\\tag{10.8}\\]\nWe can now consider two extremes; the observed wavelength in front of the source (to the right in the diagram), and the observed wavelength behind the source (to the left in the diagram):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\lambda^\\prime_{\\textsf{behind}} = \\dfrac{v+u_{s}}{f_{0}} && \\lambda^\\prime_{\\textsf{in front}} = \\dfrac{v-u_{s}}{f_{0}}\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{10.9}\\]\nWe can now determine the frequency observed by using these expressions for the wavelength. Firstly, we determine the number of wavefronts passing the observer in the time frame \\(\\Delta t\\):\n\\[\nN_{\\textsf{obs}} = \\frac{v_{\\textsf{obs}}\\Delta t}{\\lambda'}\n\\tag{10.10}\\]\n…where \\(v_{\\textsf{obs}}\\) is the speed of the waves relative to the observer; i.e. \\(v_{\\textsf{obs}} = v \\pm u_{\\textsf{obs}}\\) ; where \\(u_{\\textsf{obs}}\\) corresponds to the observer moving to the right in the diagram (as this reduces the relative velocity between the observer and the wave). We can now rewrite the expression in Equation 10.10 in terms of the phase velocity \\(v\\) and the relative speed of the observer, \\(u_{\\textsf{obs}}\\):\n\\[\nN_{\\textsf{obs}} = \\frac{(v \\pm u_{\\textsf{obs}})\\Delta t}{\\lambda'}\n\\tag{10.11}\\]\n…and finally we have the observed frequency \\(f^\\prime\\) of a source in motion:\n\\[\nf^\\prime = \\frac{N_{\\textsf{obs}}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{v\\pm u_{\\textsf{obs}}}{\\lambda'}\n\\tag{10.12}\\]\nWhen we combine this with the equation for \\(\\lambda^\\prime\\), we obtain the general result (Equation 10.13)\n\\[\nf' = \\left(\\frac{v\\pm u_{\\textsf{obs}}}{v\\pm u_{s}}\\right)f_{0}\\quad\\textsf{or}\\quad f' = \\left(\\frac{1\\pm \\frac{u_{\\textsf{obs}}}{v}}{1\\pm \\frac{u_{s}}{v}}\\right)f_{0}\n\\tag{10.13}\\]\nIt is important to pay attention to the signs when using the above equations; it can be easy to confuse the positive directions. The sign convention can help with this:\n\nThe direction from the observer towards the source is positive\n\nYou can check your results using the principles:\n\nThe observed frequency \\(f'\\) increases when the source and observer approach each other;\nThe observed frequency \\(f'\\) decreases when the source and observer move apart."

The resonant behaviour will differ depending on whether the other end of the pipe is open or closed. We will consider each of these cases in turn.\n\n11.6.1 Pipes open at both ends\nIn this model, the column of air is able to vibrate at its ends, so we have a similar set of harmonics as for a string, but with displacement antinodes at its ends (the air can vibrate freely at the ends of the tube). There is a second set of nodes/antinodes corresponding to the pressure; these do not align with the displacement nodes/antinodes; rather a pressure node aligns with a displacement antinode and vice versa. (if an air molecule does not move, we have a displacement node, but it is continuously ‘squashed’ from both sides by the oscillating air molecules, so experiences the biggest pressure change).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: This image shows the node/antinode structure of a standing wave in a closed tube. Note the presence of a displacement node at either end where molecules are compressed against the end of the tube.\n\n\n\n\nWe observe all harmonics in this system; there are no concerns about ‘position of plucking’ that there is for the string.

The imaginary number, \\(\\mathrm{i}\\), is defined using the process shown in Equation 12.2:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nx^2 &=& -1 \\\\\nx &=& \\pm \\mathrm{i}\\\\\ni^2 &=& -1\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{12.2}\\]\nThe terms ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ are nothing more than labels. Neither is any more or less “realistic” than the other nor is it any less valid. Some may claim that the number \\(\\mathrm{i}\\) is a ‘pretend’ number; however were this to be true, it would not be as useful as it is!1.\nThe next useful concept to recall is the complex conjugate, \\(z^*\\). This is defined as in Equation 12.3:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nz &=& a + \\mathrm{i}b \\\\\nz* &=& a - \\mathrm{i}b \\\\\nzz^* &=& a^2 + b^2\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{12.3}\\]\nIn general, for any complex number of the form \\(z = a \\pm \\mathrm{i}b\\), there exists its complex conjugate, \\(z^* = a \\mp \\mathrm{i}b\\) such that \\(zz^*\\) is a wholly real number and equal to \\(a^2 + b^2\\).\nThe complex conjugate is particularly useful when finding fractions of complex numbers as it is used to make the denominator of the fraction wholly “real”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful results with complex numbers\n\n\n\nFor a pair of complex numbers, \\(z_1\\) and \\(z_2\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nz_1 &=& a_1 + \\mathrm{i}b_1 \\\\\nz_2 &=& a_2 + \\mathrm{i}b_2\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{12.4}\\]\n…we can establish the following principles:\n\nEquality:\n\n\\[\n\\textrm{If} \\hspace{15pt} a_1 = a_2 \\hspace{15pt} \\textbf{and} \\hspace{15pt} b_1 = b_2  \\hspace{15pt} \\textrm{then}  \\hspace{15pt} z_1 = z_2\n\\]\n\nAddition and subtraction:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nz_1 + z_2 &=& (a_1 + a_2) + \\mathrm{i}(b_1 + b_2) \\\\\nz_1 - z_2 &=& (a_1 - a_2) + \\mathrm{i}(b_1 - b_2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nProducts:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nz_1 \\times  z_2 &=& (a_1 + \\mathrm{i}b_1) (a_2 + \\mathrm{i}b_2) \\\\\n&=& (a_1 a_2 - b_1 b_2) + \\mathrm{i}(a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nReciprocal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{z^* }{z z^* } = \\frac{a - \\mathrm{i}b }{a^2 + b^2 }\n\\]\n\nDivision:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{z_1 z_2^* }{z_2 z_2^* } = \\frac{(a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2) - \\mathrm{i}(a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1)}{a_2^2 + b_2^2 }\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications of the complex conjugate\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n(z_1 + z_2)^* &=& z_1^* + z_2^*\\\\\n(z_1  z_2)^* &=& z_1^* z_2^* \\\\\n\\left( \\dfrac{z_1}{z_2} \\right)^* &=& \\dfrac{z_1^* }{z_2^* } \\\\\na = \\mathrm{Re}(z) &=& \\dfrac{1}{2}(z + z^* ) \\\\\nb = \\mathrm{Im}(z) &=& \\dfrac{1}{2}(z - z^* )\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{12.5}\\]\n\n\n\n\n12.1.2 The Argand Diagram\nSince a complex number consists of two independent components, we have another way to describe these numbers. Complex numbers can be plotted on a graph, with the ‘real’ component plotted on one axis (the \\(x\\)-axis) and the ‘imaginary’ component plotted on the other axis (the \\(y\\)-axis). This is the basis of the Argand diagram (Figure 12.1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: A typical Argand diagram, showing the Real (‘Re’) axis and the Imaginary (‘Im’) axis. The point \\(P\\) can be defined in ‘\\(x,y\\)’ terms (the ‘complex number’), or can be defined as polar ‘\\(r,\\theta\\)’ terms (termed ‘modulus’ and ‘argument’)\n\n\n\n\nThis allows us to define a complex number in terms of a modulus (radial distance from the origin) and an argument (angle from the ‘real’ axis). Useful properties of the modulus are listed in Equation 12.6:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n|z^* | &=& |z| \\\\\nzz^* &=& |z^2| \\\\\n|z_1 z_2| &=& |z_1 | |z_2| \\\\\n|\\dfrac{z_1}{z_2}| &=& \\dfrac{|z_1|}{|z_2|} \\\\\n\\\\\n|z_1 + z_2| &\\neq& |z_1 | + |z_2|\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{12.6}\\]\nThe Argand diagram is a representation of the complex plane, through which it becomes possible to visualise properties of complex numbers. One example of this is the addition of complex numbers; these can be considered to behave as vectors (Figure 12.2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Addition of complex numbers \\(z_1\\) and \\(z_2\\) can be shown grapically on an Argand diagram; the separate consideration of the ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ components is analogous to the separate consideration of vector components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.3 Polar representation of complex numbers\nAs well as the Cartesian interpretation of the Argand diagram, we can also consider a polar representation of a complex number; where instead of “real” and “imaginary” components acting as \\((x,y)\\) coordinates, we define the position of the complex number on the complex plane as a radius and an angle, \\(\\theta\\). We have already illustrated this in Figure 12.1\nIn this representation, the complex number can be expressed a different way:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n& z = a + \\mathrm{i}b & \\\\\n& r = |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} & \\\\\na = r\\cos \\theta & b = r \\sin \\theta & \\theta = \\mathrm{arg} (z) = \\arctan \\left( \\dfrac{b}{a} \\right) \\\\\n& z = r \\cos \\theta + \\mathrm{i}|z| \\sin \\theta &\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nNormally, \\(\\theta\\) will lie in the range such that \\(-\\pi &lt; \\theta \\leq \\pi\\), meaning that our complex number representation is now shown in Equation 12.7:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nz = a + \\mathrm{i}b = r \\cos \\theta + \\mathrm{i} r \\sin \\theta \\\\\nz = r \\left( \\cos \\theta + \\mathrm{i} \\sin \\theta \\right)\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{12.7}\\]\n\n\n12.1.4 Exponential representation of complex numbers\nThe exponential representation of a complex number takes the general form of \\(z = Ae^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta}\\). This is based on series expansions of \\(\\cos \\theta\\) and \\(\\mathrm{i}\\sin \\theta\\), which shows De Moivre’s theorem. Key results from this are shown in Equation 12.8:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta} &= &\\cos \\theta + \\mathrm{i}\\sin \\theta\\\\\n\\left( \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta} \\right)^n &=& \\left( \\cos \\theta + \\mathrm{i}\\sin \\theta \\right)^n = \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}n\\theta} \\\\\n\\left( \\cos \\theta + \\mathrm{i}\\sin \\theta \\right)^n &=&  \\cos n\\theta + \\mathrm{i}\\sin n \\theta\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{12.8}\\]\nThis means that we obtain the following representations for complex numbers:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nz = r \\left( \\cos \\theta + \\mathrm{i}\\sin \\theta \\right) = r\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta}\\\\\nz^* = r \\left( \\cos \\theta - \\mathrm{i}\\sin \\theta \\right) = r\\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\theta}\\\\\n\\textrm{where:} \\hspace{15pt} r = |z| \\hspace{20pt} \\theta = \\textrm{arg}(z)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nCombining these with Equation 12.5 we also note the following useful results (Equation 12.9)\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\cos \\theta &=& \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta} + \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\theta} \\right)\\\\\n\\sin \\theta &=& \\frac{1}{2\\mathrm{i}} \\left( \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta} - \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\theta} \\right)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{12.9}\\]\n\n\n12.1.5 Complex representation of oscillations\nHaving quickly readdressed our understanding of complex numbers, we now turn our attention to the application of these in the context of oscillations and waves.\nConsider the general equation of SHM (Equation 12.10), derived from Equation 1.8)\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d} t^2 } + \\omega^2 u = 0\n\\tag{12.10}\\]\nAs has been previously discussed, sinusoidal functions can form the basis of solutions to this differential equation; so both \\(\\cos \\omega t\\) and \\(\\sin \\omega t\\) are solutions to this equation. Therefore, any linear combination of these solutions will also be a solution, i.e. the linear combination shown here:\n\\[\nu = c_1 \\cos \\omega t + c_2 \\sin \\omega t\n\\]\n… will also satisfy Equation 12.10. This can be extended using De Moivre’s theorem (Equation 12.8) allowing an exponential representation of an oscillation as shown in Equation 12.11:\n\\[\nu = A (\\cos \\omega t + \\mathrm{i} \\sin \\omega t) \\equiv A \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}\n\\tag{12.11}\\]\nTherefore the solution \\(u = A\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}\\) represents an oscillation with amplitude \\(A\\) and frequency \\(\\omega\\)\n\n\n12.1.6 Take-home points\n\nWe can always represent an oscillation using a complex exponential function\nTo obtain the actual physical displacement of the system we simply examine either the real or the imaginary part of the solution:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lrcl}\n\\textsf{Either:} & \\textrm{displacement} &=& \\mathrm{Re}(u) = A \\cos \\omega t \\\\\n\\textsf{or:} & \\textrm{displacement} &=& \\mathrm{Im}(u) = A \\sin \\omega t\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe main advantage of working with complex exponentials is that they are considerably easier to manipulate than the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. In general it is far easier to use this exponential notation when multiplying oscillations (such as you will explore in electrical circuits later). However, when adding oscillations or waves you may find it easier using a trigonometric identity.\nYou should be comfortable using either approach to represent an oscillation."
